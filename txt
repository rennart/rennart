00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,060
We come to you now with
revelations about last week's attack

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,640
in London. An anonymous
source provided this video.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,250
It shows Quentin Beck, aka
Mysterio, moments before his death.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,930
A warning, you may
find this video disturbing.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,100
I managed to send the
Elemental back through the rift but I

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,966
don't think I'm gonna make
it out of this bridge alive.

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,820
Spider-Man attacked me
for some reason. He has

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,680
an army of weaponized
drones, Stark technology.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,200
He's saying he's the only one who's
gonna be the new Iron Man, no one else.

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,080
Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,870
There will be
significant casualties.

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,550
Do it. Execute them all.

13
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,290
This shocking video
was released earlier today

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,420
on the controversial news
website TheDailyBugle.net.

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,570
There you have it, folks, conclusive
proof that Spider-Man was responsible

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,980
for the brutal murder of Mysterio,
an interdimensional warrior

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,290
who gave his life to protect
our planet, and who will no doubt

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,710
go down in history as the
greatest superhero of all time.

19
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,430
But that's not all, folks.

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,470
Here's the real blockbuster. Brace
yourselves, you might wanna sit down.

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,180
Spider-Man's real...
Spider-Man's real name is...

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,080
Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker.

23
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,820
What the f...

24
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,450
That's right, folks. Peter Parker,
a seventeen year old high school

25
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,640
delinquent,
harboring a homicidal...

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,540
Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend?
Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend?

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,100
- Spider-Man!
- He's here!

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,690
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Please don't touch her.
- You're just a kid?

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,900
You murdered Mysterio? You
helped him murder Mysterio?

30
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,580
No, I... I didn't...

31
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,560
He hit me. Spider-Man hit me!

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,540
He hit me. Spider-Man hit me!

34
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,790
People looked up to this
boy and called him a hero.

35
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,440
I'll tell you what I call him:
Public Enemy Number One!

36
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,330
I don't ever wanna
do this ever again!

37
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,450
MJ, I'm so sorry but I can't see
anything with your hand in my...

38
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,146
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay,
where are we gonna go?

39
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,710
- I don't know. Your house.
- Oh, no! We can't go to my house.

40
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,140
- My Dad will kill you!
- What?

41
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,810
I thought you said your
Dad really liked me?

42
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,350
Yeah, well, not anymore.

43
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,020
- Dude.
- Dude!

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,440
- Dude.
- Dude!

45
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,580
- Dude.
- Dude!

46
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:12,150
- Dude!
- What... I'm so sorry!

47
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,940
- Are you okay?
- No, not really.

48
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,350
Yo, Peter!

49
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,750
We should go. We
should go. Come on.

50
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,100
- But you said you don't wanna swing...
- You should just swing me. Yeah.

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,710
Okay. We can take the subway.

52
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,110
Look out!

53
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,460
That was so much worse. Okay.

54
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,240
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah...

55
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,570
Come on, come on, come
on. Okay. I'm so sorry.

56
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,590
I just feel so dumb. I didn't
realize you were miserable.

57
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,850
No, it was really fun, alright? You
know, that's why they call it a fling!

58
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,850
- And we flung.
- It was fun.

59
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,870
I could've been
more fun. I can be fun.

60
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,610
- We'll hang out again.
- Like... when do you think?

61
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,040
- I should see what that is.
- No. No, no, no, no. Happy.

62
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,640
- It's what I do.
- He's always coming and going...

63
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,660
- Peter?
- It's not...

64
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,700
- Peter? Oh. God. Peter...
- Oh, no. Oh, no. I don't know what to do!

65
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,790
Peter...

66
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,560
- Oh. Oh, no.
- We didn't see anything.

67
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,546
- This isn't what it looks like, Happy.
- I'm sorry...

68
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,806
- Just practice safe...
- It's not what it looks like.

69
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,330
Oh, hey!

70
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,950
You must be MJ!

71
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,180
- Nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

72
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,260
Wait, have you been crying?

73
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,470
We broke up.

74
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,960
- Hey, Spider-Man!
- Oh, uh...

75
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,520
Thank you. I didn't know you guys
broke up. I thought you were in love, May.

76
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,970
- No, we talked about this...
- I should probably leave, I think...

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,816
I thought you guys were
such a handsome couple...

78
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,140
- You know, it's really about boundaries...
- Oh...

79
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,730
- Oh, hey, listen. Go in here.
- Is that the door?

80
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,590
- Hey, is it true about...
- Not now!

81
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,150
Just make yourself home...

82
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,900
about sex, Peter.

83
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,020
This has nothing to do with sex.

84
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,186
God's sakes, it's the goal but
if you wanna go over it again...

85
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,700
I mean, I'm...
What's that sound?

86
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,280
Hey, Spider-Man!

87
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,410
I mean, I'm happy to rehash
it if you want to. I just don't...

88
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,440
Can you get off your
phones for like, five minutes,

89
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,900
I just wanna talk to you
about your relationship, okay?

90
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,940
Peter?

91
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,230
What?

92
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,260
- Is that...
- Is that here?

93
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,630
I mean maybe it's
not such a big deal.

94
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,940
Spider-Menace!

95
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,050
Governments around the
world launched investigations

96
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,580
into the murderer
known as Spider-Man,

97
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,660
aka, Peter Parker, aka, the
web-headed war criminal,

98
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,680
who for years has been terrorizing
the decent citizens of New York.

99
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,400
Well now, this city and the
world see him for what he truly is.

100
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,650
Murderer!

101
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,440
New details from last week's
devastating attack in London have emerged.

102
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,540
For more, we go now to
Joint Intelligence Headquarters...

103
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,970
who released just a
short while ago confirms,

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,500
that the deadly drones
used in the London attack,

105
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,920
were designed by Stark Industries.

106
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,720
- Federal agents! Open up!
- Federal agents? You stay here!

107
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,700
Department of Damage Control.

108
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,410
We have a warrant for
the arrest of Peter Parker.

109
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,750
- You know the fourth amendment?
- Sure.

110
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,490
- Unreasonable search and seizure?
- Get in here, guys. Let's go.

111
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,610
- I didn't kill Quentin Beck. The drones did.
- The drones that are yours.

112
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,030
No... Well, look...

113
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,530
Nick Fury was there the entire time.
Just ask him and he can explain everything.

114
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,170
Nick Fury has been
off-planet for the last year.

115
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,280
What?

116
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,530
Peter!

117
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,020
MJ! Uhh...

118
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,796
They had nothing
to do with it, sir!

119
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,196
- Don't say anything, we got a lawyer!
- Don't say anything, we got a lawyer.

120
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,410
I want a lawyer.

121
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,090
Miss Jones-Watson...

122
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,550
Jones. I don't go by Watson.

123
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,910
Miss Jones...

124
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,351
- Why do you want a lawyer if...
- I have nothing to hide?

125
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,380
- Exactly. Unless...
- I'm actually guilty of something?

126
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,120
I'm very aware of your
tactics and my rights.

127
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,270
Just answer my questions.

128
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,200
I've seen your file.

129
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,720
You're a smart, young woman
with a bright future ahead of her.

130
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,240
Why would you risk it all by getting
involved with a vigilante like Peter Parker?

131
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,030
So sorry to keep you waiting.

132
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,610
Can we get Ned a snack,
please? He's been waiting.

133
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,990
Dude, I'm so sorry about that.

134
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,616
I'm not supposed to
say anything to you.

135
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,940
No, Ned. Not even a thing.

136
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,310
I just have one question...

137
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,820
When MJ told you that
Peter was Spider-Man...

138
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,850
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- What's up?

139
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,790
I knew way before MJ did. I
was Spider-Man's guy in the chair.

140
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,870
Oh, I know about those.

141
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,380
I mean, half the guys
have guys in the chair.

142
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,090
Exactly! You wouldn't know...

143
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,430
I literally helped
him find the Vulture.

144
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,560
I didn't know that.

145
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,940
And I helped him hack his suit once,
and kinda helped him get to Space.

146
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,690
So, in Spider-Man's illegal vigilanteism,
you were his main accomplice.

147
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,930
I would like to have my
words strictly from the record.

148
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,240
With all due respect,

149
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,610
and I mean that
very insincerely,

150
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,670
unless you have some real
specific charges to throw at us,

151
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,840
legally, you can't hold us here.

152
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,960
You should definitely lawyer up.

153
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,990
Excuse me?

154
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,430
Child endangerment is a nasty rap.

155
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,450
The boy was entrusted to you, and as
his legal guardian, essentially his mother,

156
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,750
you not only allowed him to endanger
himself, but you actually encouraged it.

157
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,130
Who does that?

158
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,300
I wanna see Peter right now.

159
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,890
Stark Industries was caught in the web of
the Spider-Man/Mysterio controversy today,

160
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,940
when federal agents opened an investigation
into missing Stark technology.

161
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,300
The agents wanna know
exactly what was taken...

162
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,420
At least they used
a good picture.

163
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,940
That's great. Thank you.

164
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,050
Well, I have some
good news, Peter.

165
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,600
I don't believe any of the
charges against you are gonna stick.

166
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,290
- Wait, seriously?
- Oh, I knew it.

167
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,806
- Oh, my God, Mr. Murdock. Thank you.
- Yes.

168
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,510
- Thank you, Matt.
- That's amazing.

169
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,440
Well, perfect. However...

170
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,850
- Mister Hogan?
- Yes?

171
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,520
The feds are actively
investigating the missing technology.

172
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,700
I understand you're loyal to Mr. Stark
and his legacy, but if you were involved...

173
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,850
- If I was involved?
- I might secure a lawyer.

174
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,600
I need a lawyer because I'm
un... I'm under inves... I thought,

175
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,880
you said, there's no
charge. I could say

176
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,100
under advisement of counsel,
I refuse to answer the question

177
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,401
respectfully because I... the
answer could incriminate me.

178
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,776
There's a saying in Goodfellas.
What did they say in Goodfellas?

179
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,360
I know, that's
interesting... Calm down.

180
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,210
Let's hear what
he has to say. Matt?

181
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,960
You're gonna need
a really good lawyer.

182
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,340
Peter, you may have dodged your legal
troubles, but things will get much worse.

183
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,690
There is still the
court of public opinion.

184
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,710
How did you just do that?

185
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,900
I'm a really good lawyer.

186
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,550
We're gonna need
a safer place to live.

187
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,060
Alarm systems, deactivated.

188
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,560
It looks nice and... safe.

189
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,960
Welcome, to the spiritual oasis.

190
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,150
You like Donkey Kong Jr.?

191
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,550
Oh, Happy.

192
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,760
Did you send in your applications yet?

193
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,680
I literally just finished
my MIT one. You?

194
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,310
- Same.
- Imagine if we both got in?

195
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,910
- And Ned?
- Yeah, but...

196
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,740
We have to take scholarships
so we could actually go.

197
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,080
Come on. You got good
scores, and good grades, and...

198
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,310
- You think I'm being too pragmatic.
- No, no, no, no. Well...

199
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,510
Kind of. That's okay.

200
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,866
That's one of my
favorite things about you.

201
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,040
- Really?
- Yeah.

202
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,120
Well, what are your
other favorite things?

203
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,800
I love your relentless optimism.

204
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,390
Yeah. I am a "glass
half full" kind of gal.

205
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,090
I really like how
you're a people person.

206
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,280
I love people.

207
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,760
Love 'em... so much.

208
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,720
You like sports.

209
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,920
I think the Mets are gonna
go all the way this year.

210
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,080
- Really?
- What's that noise?

211
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,870
Oh. That's...
that's Happy. Look.

212
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,130
He gave his room to May,
so he's sleeping down here.

213
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,520
I have a weird question.

214
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,040
Does any part of you feel
relieved about all of this?

215
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,570
Ever since I got
bit by that Spider...

216
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,600
I've only had one week,
where my life has felt normal.

217
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,050
Well, kind of normal, I guess.

218
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,640
And...

219
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,910
That was when you found out.

220
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,770
Because then, everyone
that was in my life

221
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,990
that I wanted to
know... you know.

222
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,630
And it was perfect.

223
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,340
But now everybody knows. And...

224
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,590
I am the most famous
person in the entire world...

225
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,110
and I'm still broke.

226
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,840
I'm... excited to
see you tomorrow.

227
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,250
Yeah, me too.

228
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,650
Wrap it up.

229
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,940
You both like each
other. We get it. Hang up.

230
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,840
There's no new ground being
broken. Okay? I need my eight hours.

231
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,086
Have you been listening this whole time?

232
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,970
Hi, Happy.

233
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,520
Not by choice.

234
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,550
MJ says hi.

235
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,590
Hello.

236
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,030
We're covering the first day of senior year
for Midtown High's most famous student,

237
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,130
Peter Parker! Go get 'em, Tiger!

238
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,960
Or should I say, Spider?

239
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,250
The crowd has
continued to grow here all

240
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,090
morning long at the
Midtown School of Science...

241
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,830
The crowd seems evenly divided between
supporters of Spider-Man, and protesters.

242
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,950
MJ! MJ, we love you. MJ, are
you gonna have his spider-babies?

243
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,910
Mysterio forever! Murderer!

244
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,100
Back off!

245
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,940
- Who are you?
- I'm Ned Leeds. I'm Spider-Man's...

246
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,790
Peter Parker's best friend. You come
at my boy? You come at Flash Thompson.

247
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,890
If you wanna read about
our inspiring friendship,

248
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,900
you can now with my
new book, Flashpoint.

249
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,710
One spider, two hearts, a million
crazy-ass memories. Check it out.

250
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,190
- Go. Go. Go. Go. Go!
- No, wait up...

251
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,280
I'll see you inside, okay?

252
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:04,040
Keep watching Midtown News all year as
we bring you upclose and personal coverage

253
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,360
of Peter fighting his biggest
battle yet: college admissions.

254
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,670
Peter.

255
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,780
We would love to...

256
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,180
Welcome you back...

257
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,870
To Midtown High.

258
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,960
Where we shape heroes.

259
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,640
- Uh-huh.
- Or murderers.

260
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,910
Stop it.

261
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,060
It's an honor to serve you...

262
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,840
- Sir.
- God!

263
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,010
Mysterio was right.

264
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,590
Stop. We don't... that's all.

265
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,280
Some of the students
put this together for you.

266
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,770
No. You did that.

267
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,880
- You did that.
- I helped a little bit.

268
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,320
I tried to stop him so many
times, but you piled through.

269
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,706
- He did all of that.
- You did a great job.

270
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,610
I hope you have time
to stop and check it out...

271
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,380
And feel free to walk...

272
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,540
Or, or swing through the hallway... Or
crawl on the ceiling to avoid everybody.

273
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,860
We all know you can do it.

274
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,930
I'm just gonna...

275
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,840
You know what you did.

276
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,310
Stop it. You're
embarassing yourself.

277
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,020
He's a conspiracy theorist.

278
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,870
Can we just like,
stay up here all day?

279
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,700
- It is so crazy down there.
- Wait, this one's good.

280
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,740
Some suggest that,

281
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,456
Parker's powers
include the male spider's

282
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,250
ability to hypnotize females,

283
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,980
which he used to
seduce Jones-Watson

284
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,790
into his cult of personality.

285
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,220
Stop! Stop.

286
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,410
Yes, my Spider-lord.

287
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,000
Finally. Some privacy.

288
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,580
It is so crazy down there.

289
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,380
So, I was thinking...

290
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,420
When we get into MIT,

291
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,000
we should live together.

292
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,410
Yeah, for sure.

293
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,440
Yeah. Love that.

294
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,780
- This is gonna be us.
- Yes.

295
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,080
Minus the frisbee.

296
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,730
- And the smiling.
- MIT's obviously the dream...

297
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,900
But if we match-up
our backup schools,

298
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,170
either way, we'll all
be together in Boston.

299
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,350
New school, new town.
I can Spider-Man there.

300
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,916
I mean they have
crime in Boston, right?

301
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,296
- Yes. Yes, they do.
- Yeah, wicked crime.

302
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,980
Yeah, so it'll be
like a fresh start.

303
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,610
What's up?

304
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,860
I don't know. I just
feel like if you don't...

305
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,330
If you expect disappointment,

306
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,460
then you can never
really get disappointed.

307
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,820
Come on.

308
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
It'll be a fresh start.

309
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,950
And, we'll all be together.

310
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,600
Yeah. You're right.

311
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,980
Fresh start.

312
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,750
Fresh start.

313
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,380
First one's here!

314
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,210
It's okay. It's a backup school.

315
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,080
Peter?

316
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,610
No?

317
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,240
Last one.

318
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,780
MIT?

319
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,770
Okay.

320
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,410
- Ready?
- Jones...

321
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,680
I told you to take down
the Halloween decorations...

322
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,730
Actually, that was Sasha, so...

323
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,590
Enough attitude, just do it.

324
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,850
On it.

325
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,126
- I feel like I'm gonna puke.
- Well, don't.

326
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,160
Because, he will
just make me clean it.

327
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,630
This is our only shot.

328
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,000
It's here, or nowhere.

329
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,150
Hey! Come on.

330
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,530
Okay. You guys ready?

331
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,300
Okay. On three.

332
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,590
One...

333
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
Two...

334
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,290
Three...

335
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,650
No.

336
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,140
No. You?

337
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,430
"In light of recent
controversy, we are unable to

338
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,220
consider your application at this time."

339
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,030
This is so not fair.

340
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,730
I mean, this is so not fair.
I didn't do anything wrong.

341
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,320
And you guys definitely
didn't do anything wrong.

342
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,540
Expect disappointment, and
you will never get disappointed.

343
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,460
Busted!

344
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,120
You guys didn't get in?

345
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,560
Yeah. Because we're actually
friends with Spider-Man.

346
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,860
Uhh, yeah...

347
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,760
I better get going. There's
a mixer for new admissions...

348
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,610
And... sorry, guys.

349
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,050
Jones, what are you
doing? Get back to work.

350
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,540
Yeah. Coming.

351
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,760
You know what?

352
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,250
I wouldn't change a thing.

353
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,120
Me neither.

354
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,780
Although, I coulda just
showed this letter to my parents.

355
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,510
Umm...

356
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,680
Hi.

357
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,440
Hi!

358
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,020
I'm...

359
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,010
The most brainless
person in the world. I know.

360
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,040
Wong. Try not to slip. We
don't have liability insurance.

361
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,840
- Is all this for a holiday party?
- No.

362
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,770
One of the rotunda
gateways connects to Siberia.

363
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,810
Blizzard blasted through.

364
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,960
Because someone forgot to cast a
maintenance spell to keep the seals tight.

365
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,260
That's right. He did. Because
he forgot I now have higher duties.

366
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,570
Higher duties?

367
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,950
The Sorcerer Supreme
has high duties, yes.

368
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,826
Wait, I thought you were
the Sorcerer Supreme?

369
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,660
No. He got it on a technicality

370
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,410
'cause I blipped for five years.

371
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,190
Oh. Well, congratulations.

372
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,530
If I'd been here, then I'd...

373
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,090
Burned the place down.
You two, no one said

374
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
stop shoveling.

375
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,200
So, Peter...

376
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,250
To what do I owe the pleasure?

377
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,640
Right. Umm...

378
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,520
I'm really sorry to
bother you, sir, but...

379
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,850
Please. We saved half
the universe together.

380
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,710
I think we're beyond
you calling me sir.

381
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,420
Okay, uhh... Stephen.

382
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,420
That feels weird,
but I'll allow it.

383
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,840
When...

384
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,590
When Mysterio
revealed my identity...

385
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,210
My entire life got
screwed up, and...

386
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,716
I was wondering, I mean, I don't
even know if this would actually work,

387
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,370
but I was wondering if...

388
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,390
Maybe you could go back in time
and make it so that he never did?

389
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,140
Peter...

390
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,270
we tampered with the stability
of space-time to resurrect

391
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,020
countless lives. You wanna do it again
now just because yours got messy?

392
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,580
This isn't... it's not about me. I mean,
this is really hurting a lot of people.

393
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,630
My...

394
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,630
My Aunt May, Happy...

395
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,640
My best friend, my
girlfriend, their futures

396
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,870
are ruined just because
they know me, and...

397
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,660
They've done nothing wrong.

398
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,870
I am so sorry, but...

399
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,920
even if I wanted to...

400
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,280
I don't have the
Time Stone anymore.

401
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,660
That's right.

402
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,780
I'm really sorry if I...

403
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,940
wasted your time.

404
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,970
- You didn't...
- Just forget about it.

405
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,980
He will. He's really
good at forgetting things.

406
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,250
Wong. You've actually
generated a good idea.

407
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,260
What?

408
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,530
The runes of Cafkal.

409
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,550
The runes of Cafkal.

410
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,570
Oh, it's just a standard
spell of forgetting.

411
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,030
Won't turn back time, but at least people
will forget that you were ever Spider-Man.

412
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,940
- Seriously?
- No. Not seriously.

413
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,350
That spell travels the dark borders
between known and unknown reality.

414
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,880
It's too dangerous.

415
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,160
God, we've used
it for a lot less.

416
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,900
Do you remember the full
moon party at Kamar-Taj?

417
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,560
- No.
- Exactly.

418
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,380
Come on. Wong.

419
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,800
Hasn't he been through enough?

420
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,490
Just leave me out of this.

421
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,160
Fine.

422
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,520
Fine.

423
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,930
So what is this place?

424
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,660
The Sanctum's built at the
intersection of cosmic energy currents.

425
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,580
We were the first
to seek them out.

426
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,680
Some of these walls are
thousands of years old.

427
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,100
And they shot an episode
of Equalizer here in the 80's.

428
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,360
Well, I, umm...

429
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,390
really appreciate you
doing this for me, sir.

430
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,880
Don't mention it.

431
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,920
And don't call me sir.

432
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,470
Right. Sorry.

433
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,980
You ready?

434
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,240
I'm ready.

435
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,240
Nice knowing you, Spider-Man.

436
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,980
Wait, excuse me?

437
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,900
The entire world is about to forget
that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

438
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,140
- Including me.
- Everyone?

439
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,840
- Can't some people still know?
- That's not how the spell works.

440
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,290
Very difficult and dangerous
to change it mid-casting.

441
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,200
So my girlfriend is just gonna
forget about everything we've

442
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,540
been through? I mean, is she
even gonna be my girlfriend?

443
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,706
That depends. Was she your girlfriend
just because you're Spider-Man, or...

444
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,240
I don't know. I really hope not.

445
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,410
Alright. Fine.

446
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,010
Everyone in the world is
gonna forget you're Spider-Man,

447
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,730
except your girlfriend.

448
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,150
Thank you so much...
Oh, my God. Ned.

449
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,510
- Ned!
- What is a Ned?

450
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,600
He's my best friend so it's really
important to me that Ned knows.

451
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,230
Okay. Let's not change the
parameters of the spell anymore...

452
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,520
- While I'm casting it.
- Okay, I'm done. I swear I'm done.

453
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,590
But my Aunt May
should really know.

454
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,410
Peter, stop tampering
with the spell.

455
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,230
Once she found out that I was
Spider-Man, it was really messy, and

456
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,990
I don't think that I can
go through with that again.

457
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,840
- So, my Aunt May?
- Yes!

458
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,680
- Oh, thank you. Happy?
- No. I am annoyed.

459
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,710
No, it's a nickname.
Harold "Happy" Hogan.

460
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,290
He used to work for Tony Stark...

461
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,840
Could you just stop talking?

462
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,650
Basically, everyone who knew that I
was Spider-Man before, should still know.

463
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,950
- Did it work?
- No.

464
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,570
- You changed my spell six times.
- Five times.

465
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,240
You changed my spell.
You don't do that. I told you,

466
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,890
and that is why.

467
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,980
That spell was completely out
of control. If I hadn't shut it down,

468
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,130
something catastrophic
could've happened.

469
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,450
Stephen, listen,
I am so sorry...

470
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,940
Call me sir.

471
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,500
Sorry, sir.

472
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,430
You know, after everything we've been
through together, somehow I always forget...

473
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,210
You're just a kid.

474
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,520
Look, part of the problem,

475
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,030
it's not Mysterio.

476
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,530
It's you. Trying to
live two different lives.

477
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,870
And the longer you do that, the
more dangerous it becomes. Believe me.

478
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,790
I'm so sorry about,
you and your friends,

479
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,650
not getting into college,
but if they rejected you, and...

480
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,800
you tried to convince them to reconsider,
there is nothing else you can do.

481
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,750
When you say "convince them",

482
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,180
you mean like, I
could've called them?

483
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,230
Yeah.

484
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,020
I can do that?

485
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,850
You haven't called?

486
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,140
Well, I mean, I got their
letter, and I assumed that...

487
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,840
I'm sorry, but
are you telling me,

488
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,390
that you didn't even think to
plead your case with them first,

489
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,700
before you asked me to

490
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,390
brainwash the entire world?

491
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,810
I mean, when you
put it like that, then...

492
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,130
Come on. Pick up,
pick up, pick up...

493
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:25,170
- Dude, what? I'm busy.
- Flash, where's the MIT mixer?

494
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,040
Why?

495
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,446
Because, I need to come
and talk to someone. I'm

496
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,710
trying to get Ned and MJ a
second chance at getting in.

497
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,150
What's in it for me?

498
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,670
I'm risking a lot
just talking to you.

499
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,490
Okay. I will...

500
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,300
Pick you up and swing
you to school for a week?

501
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,540
For a month.

502
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,780
For a week.

503
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,060
- Two weeks.
- Flash, please. Come on, help me.

504
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,140
You tell everyone...

505
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,886
Okay, I'll tell everyone
that you're my best friend.

506
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,460
Flash, please help me.

507
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,220
Cool, cool, cool.

508
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,950
So there's this lady. The assistant vice
chancellor. You can plead your case with her.

509
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,350
Okay, perfect. Where is she?

510
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,940
- She left.
- To go where?

511
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,110
To the airport.

512
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,400
Stark Network, unavailable.

513
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,710
Facial recognition, unavailable.

514
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,520
Hi.

515
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,470
Yep. I can see you.

516
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,720
Mom?

517
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Okay.

518
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,210
Yeah.

519
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:02,590
- Hi. I'm Peter Parker...
- You do know you're in the street, right?

520
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,600
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
I just, I really needed to

521
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,960
talk to you, I know you're
on your way to the airport...

522
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,226
MJ Watson and Ned Leeds are the two smartest
people I've ever met in my entire life,

523
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,230
and I'm the dumbest
person, because...

524
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,700
I let them help me, but
if I didn't let them help

525
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,606
me, then millions of people
would've died, so please...

526
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,310
- Don't let MIT be dumb like me.
- MIT is dumb?

527
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,980
No! I'm saying don't
let MIT be dumb.

528
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,410
I mean, like the...

529
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,230
the dumber version of me that

530
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,040
wouldn't have let them help.

531
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,460
You didn't rehearse
that, did you, Peter?

532
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,660
Basically, what I'm trying to...

533
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,050
Why are you running? What...

534
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,460
Oh, my God. Ma'am? You
should get out of the car.

535
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,470
Everybody get off the bridge!

536
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,140
We're locked. Doors... hey!

537
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,950
Hello, Peter.

538
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,470
Hi?

539
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,610
- Have we... Do I know you?
- What have you done with my machine?

540
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,680
Your ma...

541
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,706
I don't know what you're
talking about. What machine?

542
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:27,120
The power of the sun, in
the palm of my hand. It's gone.

543
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,280
Listen, sir. If you
stop smashing cars,

544
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,080
we could work together and I
can help you find your machine.

545
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,910
You wanna play games?

546
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,920
Catch!

547
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,740
It's okay. You guys are fine,
you're safe. Get out of here.

548
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,680
You think your fancy
new suit's gonna save you?

549
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,380
I should've killed your little
girlfriend when I had the chance.

550
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,140
What did you just say?

551
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,560
Looks like we got competition.

552
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,530
Peter! Help!

553
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,490
Don't worry, Ma'am! I'm coming!

554
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,860
Peter!

555
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,290
Ma'am, just stay calm.

556
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,400
- Just take a deep breath. Are you okay?
- No!

557
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,290
I've got it all under control.

558
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,890
Suit compromised.

559
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,870
Nanotechnology.

560
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,160
You've outdone yourself, Peter.

561
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,810
I underestimated you.

562
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,320
But now, you die.

563
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,510
You're not Peter Parker.

564
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,710
I am so confused right now.

565
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,900
- What's happening?
- New device detected.

566
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,580
Pairing new device.

567
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,970
Don't listen to him,
you listen to me.

568
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,900
Hey.

569
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,850
Hey. Hey! Listen to me.

570
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,010
No, not him. Me!

571
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,180
Ma'am are you okay? Come
on, you can still make your flight.

572
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
Peter.

573
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,090
You're a hero.

574
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,240
No. Well, I'm...

575
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,460
No, I'm...

576
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,900
I'm gonna talk to
admissions about your friends,

577
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,140
and I'm gonna talk
to them about you.

578
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,090
No, but, Ma'am,
this isn't about me.

579
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,860
I'm going to talk to them
about your friends, and you.

580
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,700
- Okay?
- Really?

581
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,290
And if you keep
your noses clean,

582
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,930
maybe you'll have a fair shot.

583
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,360
Here. Get out of the
way. Let me get that man.

584
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,610
You. I see you.

585
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,710
Come here!

586
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,840
That was not okay.

587
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,000
Unbelievable.

588
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,600
Until you stop
trying to kill me,

589
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,040
I'm in control, buddy.

590
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,820
Of this whole tentacle
situation you got going on here.

591
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,430
Okay? Now, who are
you? What is going on...

592
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,590
Osborn?

593
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,250
Doctor?

594
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,920
Be careful what
you wish for, Parker.

595
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,660
Let me out of here!

596
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,930
Can you please explain
to me what is going on?

597
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,810
That little spell that you botched
where you wanted everyone to forget

598
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,130
that Peter Parker is Spider-Man, it
started pulling in everyone who knows

599
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,620
Peter Parker is Spider-Man,
from every universe into this one.

600
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,460
From every universe?

601
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,140
Who are you? Where am I?

602
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,676
I think it's better if we don't
engage with him because, frankly,

603
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,970
the Multiverse is a concept
about which we know

604
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,650
frighteningly little.

605
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,890
The multiverse is real?

606
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,640
This shouldn't even be possible.

607
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,686
But I thought you
stopped the spell?

608
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:38,110
No, I contained it, but it would appear
that a few of them squeaked through.

609
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,560
After you left, I detected
an otherworldly presence.

610
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:46,390
I pursued it into the sewers, where I
found that slimy, green, son of a gun.

611
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,950
Spell?

612
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,280
As in, magic?

613
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,320
What is this, a birthday party?

614
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,800
Who is this clown?

615
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,270
What is this madness?

616
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,530
Watch this. Do you know a
Peter Parker who is Spider-Man?

617
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,370
Yes.

618
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,030
- Is that him?
- No.

619
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,070
See?

620
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,770
Okay, here's what we gotta do.

621
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,230
I don't know how many of these

622
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,250
- visitors we got...
- I saw another one.

623
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,670
On the bridge.

624
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,100
He was like a...

625
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,120
Like a flying green elf.

626
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,350
Well he sounds jolly. Why
don't you start with him?

627
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,310
I need you to capture
them and bring them here,

628
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,670
while I figure out
how to get them back.

629
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,520
Before they destroy the
fabric of reality, or worse,

630
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,750
Wong finds out.

631
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,500
Uhh... Doctor Strange?

632
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,070
What?

633
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,610
My friends and I just got a
second chance at getting into MIT.

634
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,380
If the school sees
me fighting these...

635
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,600
- crazy monsters,
- Hey, watch your mouth!

636
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,630
- I'm sorry.
- You're seriously still talking about college?

637
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,800
Hey, what did you just do?

638
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,820
This.

639
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,000
How did you do that?

640
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,530
Lots of birthday parties.

641
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,050
Hey!

642
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,780
One shot, send them here,
and move on. You're welcome.

643
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,820
Get to work.

644
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,920
Sir?

645
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,340
Now what?

646
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,380
I know this is my
mess, and I swear to you

647
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,240
that I'll fix it, but I'm
gonna need some help.

648
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,370
I can't believe I'm in
the Sanctum Sanctorum.

649
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,720
Neither can I.

650
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,070
So...

651
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,756
How did you know you're made of magic Because
my nanna says that we have it in our family,

652
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,830
and sometimes I get
these tinglings in my hand...

653
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,390
You should talk
to your physician.

654
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,240
Peter!

655
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,300
- Hey!
- Hey.

656
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,540
I'm so sorry for dragging you in this,
you just gotta help me find these guys...

657
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:40,670
You don't have to apologize.
You got us a second shot at MIT.

658
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:44,070
So, how did the
bad guys get here?

659
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,670
He screwed up a spell
trying to get you into college.

660
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,941
- Wait, what? I thought it was a magic laser?
- You did it with magic?

661
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,240
No, that was after. Let's just
focus on the good news, okay?

662
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,060
No, let's just focus
on the bad news.

663
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,810
As of now, you have detected

664
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,770
zero multiversal
trespassers, so...

665
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,150
Get on your phones,

666
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,050
scour the internet, and...

667
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,420
Scooby-Doo this shit!

668
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,590
You're telling us what to do,

669
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,100
even though it was your spell,

670
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,960
that got screwed up. Meaning
that all of this is kind of your mess.

671
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,200
You know, I know

672
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,710
a couple of magic words myself,
starting with the word 'please'.

673
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,570
Please, Scooby-Doo this shit.

674
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,800
You can work in the undercroft.

675
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,060
The undercroft?

676
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,750
Badass.

677
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,846
Guys, listen. About
this whole spell thing...

678
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,490
It's totally okay.

679
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,200
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

680
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,900
I mean, I get it. You were...

681
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,130
just trying to fix things...

682
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,570
And so...

683
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,310
Maybe just run it by us
next time, you know?

684
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:56,350
That way, when you're thinking, "Hey,
I'm about to do something that could...

685
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,100
break the universe",
we could like, help you.

686
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,910
Workshop something, or...

687
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,350
brainstorm ideas.

688
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,380
Deal.

689
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:09,820
Ned?

690
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,770
Oh, dude. I don't care.
And seriously, not a big deal.

691
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,680
A torture rack.

692
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,300
That is a pilates machine.

693
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,470
- That is...
- The crypt.

694
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,570
Okay, so we get
the rest of the guys.

695
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,740
You zap them, Doctor
Magic will send them back.

696
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,560
And when we get into MIT,

697
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,700
round of stale donuts, my treat.

698
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,620
Let's catch some multiverse men.

699
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,730
Hey! Who the hell are these two?

700
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,240
These are my friends.
This is MJ and this is Ned.

701
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,380
Hello.

702
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,200
I'm sorry, what was
your name again?

703
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,290
Dr. Otto Octavius.

704
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,780
Wait, no seriously,
what's your actual name?

705
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,640
Oh, is that a dinosaur?

706
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,289
If the paint won't come off, bring
it by the shelter and I'll get it out.

707
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,740
No, no, no, May.

708
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,870
We gotta find these guys first.

709
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,710
Well, finish your
mission, then come by.

710
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,920
We're having a
canned food drive.

711
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,020
I got one, I got one, I got one.

712
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,880
- Oh, May? I gotta go.
- Okay. Love you. Bye.

713
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,396
I mean you can take
the guy out of the chair

714
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,520
but you can't take
the chair out of the guy.

715
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,020
What did you find?

716
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:38,060
There's a disturbance near a military
research facility outside of the city.

717
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:41,840
And witnesses say they saw a
monster flying through the air.

718
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,496
That's gotta be the guy I
saw on the bridge, right?

719
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,870
That's impossible.

720
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,640
You know him, don't you?

721
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,670
On the bridge,
you said his name.

722
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,450
Norman Osborn.

723
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,680
Brilliant scientist.

724
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,500
Military researcher.

725
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,070
But he was greedy.

726
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:04,530
Misguided.

727
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,760
- What happened to him?
- We tire of your questions, boy!

728
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,230
Okay...

729
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,180
I gotta go. Where are we going?

730
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,790
It can't be him.

731
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,730
Why?

732
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,980
Because Norman
Osborn died years ago.

733
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,960
So either we saw someone else,

734
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:32,380
or you're flying out into
the darkness, to fight a ghost.

735
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,580
Keep an eye out on those trees,
we don't really know where this guy is.

736
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,130
I really don't know how you
do this without throwing up.

737
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,840
Did you guys see that?

738
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,880
No.

739
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,490
It's, it's really dark.

740
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,440
What's happening?

741
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,870
Peter, what is it?

742
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,420
Are you getting
the tingle thing?

743
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,720
Is the tingle thing happening?
Is your tingle tingling?

744
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,310
Are you guys seeing this?

745
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,490
- Yeah.
- Osborn?

746
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,450
No. He was green.
This guy's blue.

747
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,710
You wouldn't happen to be from
another universe, would you?

748
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,770
What's he doing?

749
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,560
I don't know. Looks
like he's charging.

750
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,480
I don't like this. Just web him.

751
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,720
Go left, left! Go left!

752
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,750
Wait! Right, right!

753
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,030
Guys!

754
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,020
This is not helping!

755
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,290
No, no, no. What happened?

756
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,600
Peter? Peter?

757
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:03,350
Whoa.

758
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,740
Peter, it's me. Flint
Marko. You remember?

759
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,450
I'm Peter, but
I'm not your Peter.

760
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,560
What do you mean you're not my
Peter? What the hell is going on?

761
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,280
I'll explain everything, but first
can you help me stop this guy?

762
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,210
Okay.

763
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,400
Okay, try to surround
him and I'll pull the plug.

764
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,970
All right, let's go.

765
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,500
I can't hold him much longer.

766
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,850
I got him. I got it.

767
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,410
Different Peter. Weird.

768
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,650
Thanks.

769
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,020
Sorry.

770
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,270
Don't worry about it.

771
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,880
I got my body back.

772
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:23,650
Hey, umm...

773
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:27,670
This is gonna sound really
crazy, but this isn't your universe.

774
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,270
Another universe?

775
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,970
- What?
- That's what I was feeling.

776
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:34,760
The power. It's different.

777
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,310
I like it.

778
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:41,200
Easy, buddy.

779
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:43,420
It's actually my
fault that you're here.

780
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:46,520
Like the universe? Or the woods?

781
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,670
- I hate the woods.
- I meant the universe, sir.

782
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:53,170
So what? You guys just gonna stand
there and act like I ain't butt-ass naked?

783
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,370
- I am.
- Uhh, no, no...

784
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:11,240
What was that? What
did you just do to him?

785
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,280
No, no, no. It's okay.

786
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,330
Did you kill him?

787
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,880
Whoa, listen. I can explain everything.
You just have to trust me, please.

788
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,410
I don't trust you.
I don't know you.

789
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,740
What is this?

790
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,330
You picked the wrong side.

791
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:28,950
Connors?

792
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,740
What?

793
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,240
You know this creature?

794
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:35,940
No, no, no, no. Not
a creature. A man.

795
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,430
From same universes.

796
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,780
Dr. Curt Connors. He was a scientist
in Oscorp when I worked there.

797
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,240
A brilliant scientist.

798
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,870
Till he turned himself
into a lizard. Then he tried

799
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,430
to turn the whole city
into lizards. It was crazy.

800
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:53,020
It wasn't crazy, Max. It was
the next step in human evolution.

801
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,520
The dinosaur can talk.

802
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,320
- Lizard.
- Right.

803
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,230
Speaking of which, what
happened to you? Last I

804
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:00,680
recall, you had bad teeth,
glasses and a comb-over.

805
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,920
Did you get a makeover?

806
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:06,150
You know I can give
you a real makeover.

807
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:08,450
- Let me guess. Into a lizard?
- Exactly.

808
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:11,290
Could you two just
shut up? Where are we?

809
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,060
- It's complicated.
- A wizard's dungeon.

810
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,830
Wizard's... Wizard's dungeon?

811
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,496
There's no real way
to sugarcoat that.

812
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,450
It's literally the
dungeon of a wizard.

813
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,060
Look, you can keep your magic.

814
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,780
I want a taste of that
new energy I just felt.

815
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,180
Oh, Peter. Hey.

816
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,180
Hey. Did those guys
come through yet?

817
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,320
There should be an
electric guy and a sand guy.

818
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,950
Yeah. They're all
here and locked up.

819
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:37,146
Perfect. I'm gonna just
stay here for a bit, and try

820
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:39,630
to fix this damage so they
don't blame it on me again.

821
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,970
- Okay.
- Hey, I...

822
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,210
I couldn't do any of
this without you, so...

823
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,980
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

824
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:50,280
Hey, ask him if this
is like a tree monster,

825
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:52,560
or like a scientist
that turned into a tree.

826
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:54,310
It's just a tree, man.

827
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:55,930
Just a tree.

828
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:16,490
Coward. We have a
new world to conquer.

829
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,910
- You make me sick.
- Leave me alone. Please.

830
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,550
Hiding in the shadows...

831
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,450
Hiding from who you truly are.

832
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,480
No!

833
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,170
You can't escape yourself!

834
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,280
- Hey, May.
- Hey, Peter.

835
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,910
I'm at work, and, umm...

836
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,670
One of the guys you're
looking for just walked in.

837
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:04,140
May? Where's May? Thank you.

838
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,370
Hey. Here he is.

839
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,590
Norman,

840
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,350
this is my nephew.

841
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:18,790
Norman Osborn?

842
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:20,060
I thought that you were...

843
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,710
I saw Spider-Man in
an ad for this place.

844
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,340
And I thought he could help me.

845
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:28,340
But you're not him.

846
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:30,640
Wait, so you want
Spider-Man's help?

847
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,590
He just wandered in.

848
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,230
I didn't know where else to go.

849
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,880
Someone's living in my house.

850
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,310
Oscorp doesn't exist.

851
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,380
My son...

852
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,650
Sometimes,

853
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,440
I'm not myself.

854
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:56,920
I'm...

855
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,600
someone else.

856
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:01,700
And, everytime he's in
control, I can't remember.

857
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,550
And now, I'm here, in
this place, in this city,

858
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:05,290
and I don't know...

859
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:08,150
I don't know what's
going on with me.

860
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,690
I don't... It doesn't
make sense.

861
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,120
He's lost.

862
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:15,600
And I don't mean
just in the cosmos.

863
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,330
I mean in his mind.

864
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,840
Are they all like this?

865
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,560
Yeah.

866
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,770
Well, I mean they all have their
own, mental or physical issues.

867
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:29,950
Well, he needs help,
but maybe they all do.

868
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,630
What, you don't
mean... No, May, this...

869
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:33,920
This isn't my problem.

870
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,780
Peter, not your problem? Mmm?

871
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,100
May...

872
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,010
Their chance of getting help is way
better back where they came from.

873
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,200
Sending them home,

874
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,376
That's the best thing
that we can do for them.

875
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,480
For them?

876
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,210
Or for yourself?

877
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:52,230
Look around you.

878
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,870
This is what we do.

879
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:55,420
We help people.

880
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,490
This is what's best, for them.

881
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:00,140
Trust me.

882
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,130
But the fact remains,

883
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,690
Spider-Man is a menace!

884
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:11,540
We'll be right back, after a brief word
from Daily Bugle supplements.

885
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,450
The only other Daily fix you need.

886
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,750
And, we're out.

887
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,390
What?

888
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,960
I got eyes on them.

889
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,426
He's with his aunt and
some guy I don't know.

890
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:26,250
You sure?

891
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,536
They're just leaving the shelter.

892
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,920
Okay. Don't lose him.

893
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:41,220
Thanks, May.

894
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,140
Hope to see you again.

895
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,590
Hey.

896
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,940
He trusts you.

897
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,420
So do I.

898
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,670
Thanks for cleaning my suit.

899
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:52,780
I'll see you later.

900
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:58,080
- Guys, this is Mr. Osborn.
- Hey, it's Doctor.

901
00:51:58,170 --> 00:51:59,170
Sorry. Umm...

902
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,640
Dr. Osborn, these are
my friends, Ned and MJ.

903
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,490
Mary Jane?

904
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,910
It's Michelle Jones, actually.

905
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,030
Fascinating.

906
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,170
Do you think there
are other Ned Leedses?

907
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,740
Octavius?

908
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,020
Osborn?

909
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,060
- What... What happened to you?
- What happened to...

910
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:42,820
- You're the walking corpse.
- What do you mean?

911
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,640
You died, Norman.

912
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,300
Years ago.

913
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,510
You're insane.

914
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,120
God, I love it here.

915
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,800
What are you talking about?

916
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,380
He's standing right there.

917
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,400
- He's not...
- Dead.

918
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:59,370
They both died. Fighting Spider-Man.

919
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,890
It was all over the news.

920
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,510
Green Goblin?

921
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:10,200
Impaled by the glider
he flew around on.

922
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,420
And a couple of years later...

923
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:14,340
You. Doc Ock.

924
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,630
Drowned in the river
with your machine.

925
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,940
That's nonsense.

926
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:21,030
Spider-Man was trying
to stop my fusion reactor.

927
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,280
So I stopped him.

928
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:27,420
I had him, by the
throat... And then, I...

929
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,840
And then I was here.

930
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,820
Oh, please. Let me
tell you something.

931
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:39,130
I was whooping
Spider-Man's ass. He'll tell you.

932
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:41,740
And then he caused an
overload. I was stuck in the grid,

933
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:44,740
absorbing data. I was about
to turn into pure energy,

934
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,580
and then...

935
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,810
And then... Oh, shit.

936
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:51,950
I was about to die.

937
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:55,210
Max, do you know? Do I die?

938
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:01,870
- Oh, great. You caught another one.
- No, wait. Strange, he's not dangerous.

939
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,130
It's okay.

940
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:09,900
What is that?

941
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,680
It's an ancient relic.
The Machinati Codamus.

942
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,310
I trapped your corrupted spell inside.
Once I've finished the proper ritual,

943
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:20,130
will reverse the spell. And send
these guys back to their universes.

944
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,670
And then what?

945
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:22,970
We perish?

946
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,430
Nah. No thanks,
I'll pass on that.

947
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,990
Let me out of here. Peter!

948
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,060
Strange...

949
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,340
We can't send
them back. Not yet.

950
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:33,560
Why?

951
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:37,270
Some of these
guys are gonna die.

952
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,670
Parker...

953
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:41,160
it's their fate.

954
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,840
Come on, Strange. Have a heart.

955
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,080
In the grand calculus
of the multiverse,

956
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,810
their sacrifice means
infinitely more than their lives.

957
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,070
I'm sorry, kid.

958
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,030
If they die, they die.

959
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:18,210
Peter!

960
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,880
Don't!

961
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:38,240
- Dude, what are you doing?
- Peter, you gotta go. Go!

962
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,950
This is why I never had kids.

963
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,640
- Give me the box.
- No.

964
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,680
Whoa!

965
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:18,870
Oh, my God. I'm dead.

966
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:21,760
You're not dead. You've just been
separated from your physical form.

967
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,800
My physical... What?!

968
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:27,690
- How are you doing that?
- I have no idea.

969
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:29,880
You should not
be able to do that.

970
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,700
This feels amazing.

971
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:44,006
That might be one of
the coolest things that's

972
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:46,210
ever happened to me. But
don't ever do that again.

973
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:54,700
Hey. Get off of me!

974
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,950
What is this place?

975
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,670
The Mirror Dimension.
Where I'm in control.

976
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,920
Strange, stop. Can we
please just talk about this?

977
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:01,410
Parker, don't you realize
that in the multiverse,

978
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,780
there are an infinite
number of people

979
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,040
who know Peter
Parker is Spider-Man.

980
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:09,020
And if that spell gets
loose, they're all coming here.

981
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,320
Look, I know. I get it. But we
can't just send them home to die.

982
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:13,719
It's their fate.

983
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,940
You can't change that anymore
than you can change who they are.

984
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:20,430
But what if we could? What
if we can change their fate?

985
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,620
What are you doing?

986
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:29,990
I'm not giving you the...

987
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:42,420
Give me that back.

988
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,850
Wait a minute, is that
an Archimedean spiral?

989
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:09,440
The Mirror Dimension is just geometry? You're
great at geometry. You can do geometry.

990
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:14,910
Square the radius, divided
by, plot points along the curve...

991
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:18,450
It's over, Parker. I'll come
pick you up when it's done.

992
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:24,960
Hey, Strange. You know
what's cooler than magic?

993
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,760
Math.

994
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:31,420
Don't do this.

995
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:34,900
Oww.

996
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:36,490
I'm sorry, sir, but...

997
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,200
I have to try.

998
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:45,880
Dude, what happened?

999
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,780
I just had a fight with
Doctor Strange and I totally won!

1000
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,030
- What?
- Look, and I stole his ring thing.

1001
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,900
I was swinging through the
city, and then I went through this...

1002
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:54,550
massive mirror thing,

1003
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,300
- and then I was back...
- Where is he? Where is he?

1004
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,370
He's trapped, but...

1005
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,450
I'm not sure for how long.

1006
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,330
You could've just left us to die.

1007
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,730
Why didn't you?

1008
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:03,380
Because that's not who he is.

1009
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,490
I think I can help you guys.

1010
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,530
If I can fix what
happened to you,

1011
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:12,540
then when you go back,
things will be different

1012
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:15,060
and you might not die
fighting Spider-Man.

1013
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:16,190
What do you mean fix us?

1014
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:18,700
- Look, our technology is advanced...
- I can help you.

1015
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:22,450
You know, I'm something
of a scientist myself.

1016
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,850
Octavius knows what I can do.

1017
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:28,310
Fix? You mean like a dog?

1018
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:29,770
I refuse.

1019
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:31,580
I can't promise
you guys anything,

1020
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:34,920
but at least this way, we actually
get to go home and have a chance.

1021
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:36,380
A second chance.

1022
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,760
I mean, come on.
Isn't that worth trying?

1023
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:40,210
Trust me, Peter...

1024
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:42,170
When you try to fix people,

1025
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,010
there are always consequences.

1026
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,670
I mean, you don't have to come.

1027
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,800
I also didn't know
that you could talk.

1028
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,380
But if you stay here...

1029
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,690
you're gonna have to
deal with the wizard.

1030
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,340
So, we go along, or die.

1031
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:57,120
Not much of a choice, is it?

1032
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,750
I just wanna go home.

1033
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:01,100
Well, I myself don't
wanna be killed,

1034
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,270
especially by a guy dressed
like Dungeons & Dragons, so...

1035
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:06,030
What's your plan?

1036
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,340
I have it all under control.

1037
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,520
What are we gonna
do about this thing?

1038
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,520
Well, we need to find
somewhere safe for it, right?

1039
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,910
- Yeah. Yes. Yes.
- You got to take it.

1040
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:19,600
Wait, what?

1041
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:22,066
If something bad happens, I'll
text you, and then you just push this

1042
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:23,536
and then it's all over,
and they'll all be gone.

1043
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,760
We're going with you.
We're not gonna leave you.

1044
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,130
You can't come with me. It's too dangerous.
You guys have already done enough.

1045
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,600
- Peter, we're in this together.
- I know we're in this together, Ned,

1046
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,250
but I can't do this if I
know that you're in danger.

1047
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:35,050
Okay? So for me, MJ,
please just take this.

1048
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:38,590
Please.

1049
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:40,770
- Fine.
- Thank you.

1050
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,770
But Peter, I swear, if I don't hear
from you, I'm pressing the button.

1051
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:46,530
- Sure.
- Okay. And I will do it!

1052
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:49,420
Yeah, we all
believe you, Michelle.

1053
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:52,320
No way that's his
girlfriend. No way.

1054
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:55,390
- She'll do it.
- Absolutely. She will.

1055
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,180
Okay.

1056
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:59,090
- See you later.
- Be safe.

1057
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,120
You too.

1058
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:03,350
Whoa.

1059
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:05,770
Okay.

1060
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,850
- Be careful, okay?
- Yeah. You too.

1061
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,450
So, uhh...

1062
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,270
Who's coming with me?

1063
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:26,260
Well, I'm in.

1064
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,570
But, if this goes sideways...

1065
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:32,680
I'm gonna fry you
from the inside out.

1066
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:47,750
- Where's Connors?
- He told me he wants to stay in the truck.

1067
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,560
- Okay.
- Alarm systems, deactivated.

1068
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,590
Okay.

1069
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,290
I feel kinda bad using
Happy's place like this.

1070
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,260
No, no, no, no.
He'll get over it.

1071
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:03,600
Sorry.

1072
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,700
So this is your plan, Peter?

1073
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:06,740
Mmm?

1074
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:09,850
No lab, no facilities, just performing
miracles in a condominium?

1075
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:13,870
What, you're gonna cook up some churros,
some frozen burritos in a microwave?

1076
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,460
I could go for a burrito.

1077
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:16,960
He's gonna kill us all.

1078
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,440
Well, let's hope not.

1079
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:20,560
You're up first, Doc.

1080
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,270
What? Hey, I told
you. I don't need fixing.

1081
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:25,850
I don't need fixing!

1082
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,050
Especially by a teenager using
scraps from a bachelor's junk drawer.

1083
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,740
No, no, no, no.

1084
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:33,320
He got something back there.

1085
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:34,610
I can feel it.

1086
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:35,920
Weird energy.

1087
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,170
What the hell is that?

1088
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:40,240
It's a fabricator.

1089
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:44,100
It can analyze, design,
construct basically anything.

1090
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,160
I thought that was a
tanning bed Happy broke.

1091
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,020
Look at that.

1092
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,830
He's gonna kill us all.

1093
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,636
So, the chip in the
back of Doc's neck

1094
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,240
was designed to protect
his brain from the A.I. system

1095
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:18,190
that's controlling these
tentacles. But if you look here...

1096
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:21,520
The chip is fried.

1097
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,470
So rather than him
being in control of the

1098
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:25,570
tentacles, the tentacles
are now in control of him.

1099
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:27,730
Which, I guess explains why...

1100
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,590
he is so miserable all the time.

1101
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:40,360
Thirsty?

1102
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:44,980
Well, yes. I am thirsty.

1103
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:47,330
Fresh water or salt?

1104
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,270
You know, because
you're an octopus.

1105
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:52,850
What?

1106
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,740
Fresh water it is.

1107
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,180
Look at this place.

1108
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,290
And all the possibilities.

1109
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:02,060
What? This condo?

1110
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:05,220
Yeah. Yeah, the condo. I love
the whole overfloor plan. No!

1111
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:07,630
No, man. I'm talking
about the world.

1112
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,650
I kinda like who I am here.

1113
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:16,780
And all that power back
there? I could be so much more.

1114
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,890
So why did you come here?

1115
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,310
I have a daughter.

1116
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,230
And I wanna see her. But he's
not gonna send anyone home.

1117
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:27,150
Till he's finished his little
science project back there.

1118
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:30,700
- You trust him?
- I don't trust anyone.

1119
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,600
How'd you end up
like that anyway?

1120
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:36,950
The place where I worked at...

1121
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:39,260
They were experimenting
with electricity

1122
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:41,770
created by living
organisms, and then...

1123
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:44,890
I fell into a vat
of electric eels.

1124
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:46,490
You're kidding.

1125
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,310
I fell into a supercollider.

1126
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,430
Damn.

1127
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:51,870
Gotta be careful where you fall.

1128
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:54,550
Remarkable.

1129
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,980
The technology and you.

1130
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:02,240
When all this is over,

1131
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,590
if you need a job and you're

1132
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,430
willing to commute
to another universe...

1133
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:16,600
It worked. That totally worked!

1134
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,460
I got it. I did it. I did
it. Will you send him up?

1135
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:20,520
Yup. Here we go.

1136
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:23,410
- Sorry.
- Hold on, Doc.

1137
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:25,970
All of these
humiliations never cease.

1138
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:29,030
You! Keep your science
fair project away from me!

1139
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:30,580
Hey, it will work. Have faith.

1140
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:33,490
Says the reckless fool who
turned himself into a monster.

1141
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,230
Please stop. Hold still.

1142
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:39,840
Don't you dare.

1143
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:48,030
I swear... when I get out
of this wicker, I'm gonna...

1144
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:54,260
Doc?

1145
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,160
Doc?

1146
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,100
Doc?

1147
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:06,380
Doctor Octavius?

1148
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:14,810
It's so quiet...

1149
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:19,480
Those voices...

1150
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:21,280
Inside my head...

1151
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:27,710
I'd almost forgotten...

1152
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,410
Otto.

1153
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:32,240
Yes.

1154
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:33,830
Norman.

1155
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:40,730
It's me.

1156
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,730
Would you look at that.

1157
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:08,160
I'm grateful, dear boy. Truly.

1158
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,990
Yeah. You're welcome.

1159
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,850
How can I help?

1160
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:14,200
This is Peter. Leave a message.

1161
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:18,770
Yeah, Peter, this is Happy. I
accessed my doorbell camera...

1162
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:21,270
Who are those guys,
huh? Is that a cyborg, you

1163
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:23,500
bring a cyborg with robot
legs into my house?

1164
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:26,260
One of the guys was made of
mud? What's going on? Call me back.

1165
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:36,870
How does it feel, Norman?

1166
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,850
You're about to
become whole again.

1167
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,840
No more darker half.

1168
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:45,090
Just you.

1169
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,130
Just me.

1170
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:57,630
Okay. Umm...

1171
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:01,100
It just goes right
here, this one...

1172
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:03,640
That should be drawing power now.

1173
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:05,990
I'm gonna come back in a
second just to check on it, but...

1174
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:08,330
Keep an eye on the lights.
When they're all green, it

1175
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:10,610
means all the electricity
in your body's dissipated.

1176
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,786
Well, not all the electricity.

1177
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,870
I mean, obviously you know you need
electricity for your brain to function...

1178
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:15,920
Your nervous system is...

1179
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:19,220
I'm not really sure why I'm
explaining electricity to you.

1180
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,520
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1181
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,320
Are these your legos?

1182
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:26,130
I gotta go.

1183
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:27,500
I'll be back.

1184
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,030
- Something feels off.
- What do you mean?

1185
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,960
- I don't like this.
- Leave it alone.

1186
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:43,030
The sooner you guys get through
with this, the sooner we go home.

1187
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:53,020
- Well? Where is he?
- He's inside.

1188
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:56,570
And yet here we are outside. Did
you not hear me say don't lose him?

1189
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:59,100
I want incriminating
footage of Spider-Man.

1190
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:03,400
I already called
Damage Control...

1191
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,000
Peter?

1192
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:29,310
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

1193
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:31,630
May?

1194
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:38,900
What is it, Peter?

1195
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,170
What's up, Peter?

1196
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:56,090
Why are you looking
at me like that?

1197
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:16,320
That's some neat trick.
That sense of yours.

1198
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:17,240
Norman?

1199
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:19,370
Norman's on sabbatical, Ottie.

1200
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,440
The hell?

1201
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:22,840
Goblin.

1202
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:29,250
No more darker half? Did you
really think that I'd let that happen?

1203
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:32,410
That I'd let you take away
my power just because

1204
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:35,610
you're blind to what
true power can bring you?

1205
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:37,630
- You don't know me.
- Don't I?

1206
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:43,450
I saw how she trapped you.

1207
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:47,190
Fighting her holy moral mission.

1208
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,600
We don't need you to save us.

1209
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,890
We don't need to be fixed.

1210
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:59,560
These are not curses.

1211
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:02,250
They're gifts.

1212
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:04,270
Norman, no.

1213
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:06,920
- Quiet, lapdog.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

1214
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:11,870
I watched you from deep
behind Norman's cowardly eyes.

1215
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:18,370
Struggling, to have
everything you want,

1216
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:21,970
while the world tries
to make you choose.

1217
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:27,020
Gods don't have to choose.

1218
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:30,590
We take.

1219
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:32,450
May, run!

1220
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,690
Oh, my God. What have you done?

1221
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:00,890
I liked you better before.

1222
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:13,200
Up here! He's up there.
It's the guy from the bridge.

1223
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:37,600
Did you see that?

1224
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,000
Get off me!

1225
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:16,880
Strong enough to have it all...

1226
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:21,670
Too weak to take it!

1227
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,490
Now I've gotcha.

1228
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:02,560
I told you there'd
be consequences!

1229
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:22,560
Your weakness, Peter...

1230
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:24,380
is morality.

1231
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:26,680
It's choking you.

1232
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:29,270
Can you feel it?

1233
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,410
It didn't work.

1234
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:41,070
Norman was right.

1235
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:42,426
He got it from
you. That pathetic

1236
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:45,410
sickness!

1237
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,560
You tried to fix me...

1238
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,830
May, go... May...

1239
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:55,950
Now, I'm gonna fix you.

1240
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:01,240
May, run, please...

1241
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:05,800
May!

1242
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:14,090
Peter, Peter, Peter...

1243
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:17,390
No good deed goes unpunished.

1244
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:20,450
You can thank me later.

1245
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,400
No!

1246
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,240
- May?
- Peter...

1247
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:00,040
May, May... I'm here.

1248
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:05,990
I'm here.

1249
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:09,170
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1250
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:14,510
Really?

1251
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:15,540
Yeah.

1252
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,680
It's okay. We're okay, right?

1253
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:18,220
Yeah.

1254
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,440
Knocked off my head.

1255
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:20,980
- Yeah, me too.
- That's all.

1256
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,940
I think I broke my ribs.

1257
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,410
This is all my fault, May.

1258
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:33,990
I should've just listened to
Strange and let him send them back...

1259
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:35,310
You did the right thing.

1260
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:37,670
They would have been killed.

1261
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:39,160
You did the right thing.

1262
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:41,750
It's not my responsibility, May.

1263
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:46,980
What Norman said?

1264
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:49,740
My moral mission. No.

1265
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:52,410
No, Peter. Listen.
You listen to me.

1266
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:54,820
You have a gift.

1267
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:57,590
You have power.

1268
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,860
And with great power,

1269
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:03,290
there must also come
great responsibility.

1270
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,600
Yeah. I know.

1271
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,000
Let's get out of here.

1272
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:13,390
Okay, let's go.

1273
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:33,940
What happened? Are you okay?

1274
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:36,180
Yeah, you're okay.
What happened?

1275
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:40,880
Just have to... to
catch my breath...

1276
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:42,780
Okay. Well, catch your
breath. I'm right here.

1277
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:44,100
We're gonna take our time,

1278
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,340
you catch your breath, and...

1279
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:47,200
and we'll take you
to a Doctor, okay?

1280
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:06,670
Are you okay?

1281
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:09,206
Somebody help. I
need an ambulance.

1282
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:10,700
Please, somebody...

1283
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:11,870
What happened?

1284
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:15,240
Nothing. You're okay. You're okay.

1285
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,760
I'll just... catch my breath...

1286
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:21,860
Okay. I'm right
here. I'm right here.

1287
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,320
I'm right here.

1288
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:31,330
We're okay.

1289
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:34,080
Just me and you.

1290
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:44,830
May?

1291
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,530
May?

1292
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:00,610
Will you look at
me, May? Please?

1293
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:11,870
May? May?

1294
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:17,590
What are you doing, May? Please, will
you just wake up and talk to me, please?

1295
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,150
Peter!

1296
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:00,550
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1297
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:09,660
Run!

1298
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,740
Tragedy.

1299
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:40,080
What else can I call it?

1300
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:42,560
What more need be said?

1301
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:44,450
The damage...

1302
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:46,580
The destruction...

1303
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:48,950
You saw it with your own eyes.

1304
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:52,950
When will people
wake up, and realize

1305
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:55,480
that everywhere
Spider-Man goes...

1306
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,830
Chaos and calamity ensue.

1307
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:03,570
Everything Spider-Man
touches comes to ruin.

1308
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:09,000
And we, the innocents, are
left to pick up the pieces.

1309
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:13,390
J. Jonah Jameson, reporting.

1310
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:14,700
Good night.

1311
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:17,000
And God help us all.

1312
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:45,560
Still nothing?

1313
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:48,060
No.

1314
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:05,220
I'm gonna press it.

1315
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:09,390
- What? No!
- Peter told me to wait, but...

1316
01:23:10,970 --> 01:23:12,080
I'm gonna do it.

1317
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:14,820
I just wish... I just wish
that we could see him.

1318
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:21,620
- Ned?
- Yeah?

1319
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,070
Do that again.

1320
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:24,360
Yeah.

1321
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:28,150
I just wish we could see him.

1322
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:32,380
Okay...

1323
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,800
I just wish we could see Peter.

1324
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,590
Salamangkero!

1325
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:43,780
You're right. I am magic.

1326
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:47,990
- Is that him?
- Yeah, yeah. It has to be.

1327
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,960
- Peter. Peter!
- Hey, Peter!

1328
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:51,020
Peter!

1329
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,010
Hi. Hi!

1330
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:04,700
No, no, no. It's okay,
it's okay. I'm a nice guy.

1331
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:07,940
Okay...

1332
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:12,040
Who the hell are you?

1333
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:13,390
I'm Peter Parker.

1334
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:14,540
That's not possible.

1335
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:15,960
I am Spider-Man.

1336
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:19,350
In my world. But
then, yesterday?

1337
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:20,920
I was...

1338
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:24,470
I was just here.

1339
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:26,480
Wow.

1340
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:30,340
String theory...

1341
01:24:30,590 --> 01:24:32,530
Multidimensional reality...

1342
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:35,590
And matter displacement.

1343
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:36,980
All real?

1344
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:38,130
Yeah...

1345
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:39,450
Knew it!

1346
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,620
This has to be
because of the spell.

1347
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:44,200
The spell?

1348
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:45,990
- Like magic spell?
- There's no spell.

1349
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:46,780
- No spell.
- No.

1350
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:48,140
Magic's real here, too?

1351
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:49,210
- I mean..
- Shut up, Ned.

1352
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,600
No, it's not real.

1353
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:51,640
- Shut up.
- I mean...

1354
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,560
There's magicians and
stuff, but there's no like...

1355
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,880
Stop it. Stop.

1356
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:57,840
- Prove it.
- Prove what?

1357
01:24:57,870 --> 01:24:58,980
That you're Peter Parker.

1358
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,130
I don't carry an ID
with me, you know?

1359
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:03,560
Kinda defeats the whole
anonymous superhero thing?

1360
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,380
Why'd you do that?

1361
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:08,786
To see if you have
the tingle thing.

1362
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:10,760
I have the tingle thing,
just not from bread.

1363
01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:14,890
Can you not throw the bread again?
You're a deeply mistrusting person...

1364
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:17,660
And I respect that.

1365
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:25,490
- Crawl around.
- Crawl around?

1366
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:27,120
- Yes.
- No.

1367
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:28,856
- Crawl around.
- Why do I need to crawl around?

1368
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,476
- Cause it's not enough.
- This is plenty.

1369
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,980
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

1370
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:34,310
- Nuh-uh.
- How do I stick to the ceiling?

1371
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:35,380
Do it.

1372
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:46,530
My Lola's asking if you could
just get the cobweb there.

1373
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:48,810
- It's too, like, up there?
- Yeah.

1374
01:25:57,290 --> 01:25:58,450
Thank you.

1375
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:03,380
We're good?

1376
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:04,850
We're good.

1377
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,250
For now.

1378
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,580
So, I opened a wrong portal
to the wrong Peter Parker.

1379
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,500
Yeah, I guess you just keep
doing it until you find the real one.

1380
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:14,070
- Ouch.
- No offense.

1381
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:15,510
- Okay.
- Okay.

1382
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,610
You got it.

1383
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:19,850
Find Peter Parker.

1384
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:21,770
What's with the eyes and hand?

1385
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:23,970
Find Peter Parker.

1386
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:27,830
Find Peter Parker!

1387
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:38,770
Great, it's just
some random guy.

1388
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:40,240
Hello.

1389
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:43,950
I hope it's okay, I just
came through this...

1390
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:46,490
It just closed.

1391
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,060
You're Peter?

1392
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:52,170
Yeah. Peter Parker.

1393
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,800
I... I've seen you two...

1394
01:26:58,420 --> 01:26:59,420
Hi.

1395
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:04,580
Wait. He's...

1396
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,060
He's not your friend...

1397
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,800
Whoa, it's... So you're
Spider-Man too?

1398
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:25,190
Why didn't you just say that?

1399
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:27,740
I generally don't go
around advertising it.

1400
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,230
Kinda defeats the whole
anonymous superhero thing.

1401
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:32,450
- That's what I just said...
- That's what he just said.

1402
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:47,390
My Lola's asking if you could
clean up the webs that you just shot.

1403
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:48,470
Oh. Sorry, Lola.

1404
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:49,560
Yes, of course.

1405
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:50,740
I'm going to bed.

1406
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:51,980
Good night, Lola.

1407
01:27:53,830 --> 01:27:56,590
This might seem
kind of weird, but...

1408
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:59,880
I've been trying to find your
friend ever since I got here.

1409
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:02,940
I just had this sense that...

1410
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:06,130
That he needs my help.

1411
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,310
Our help.

1412
01:28:09,670 --> 01:28:10,680
He does.

1413
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:11,990
We don't know where he is.

1414
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,100
And, umm...

1415
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:16,170
Honestly, right now,
we're all he really has left.

1416
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:20,450
Well, is there some place,

1417
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:24,700
that he might go that
has meaning to him?

1418
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:27,450
Like a...

1419
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:29,630
a place where he
would go to just...

1420
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,260
Get away from everything?

1421
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:37,410
For me, it was the top
of the Chrysler Building.

1422
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,310
Empire State.

1423
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:41,060
Better view.

1424
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:42,270
That is a sweet view.

1425
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:46,190
Yes.

1426
01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:49,750
Yeah, I think I know
exactly where that would be.

1427
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:35,880
Peter, there's...

1428
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:39,520
there's some people here...

1429
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:40,990
Who?

1430
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,110
Hey. Wait, wait, whoa.

1431
01:29:56,970 --> 01:29:58,500
Sorry...

1432
01:29:59,510 --> 01:30:01,220
About May.

1433
01:30:04,330 --> 01:30:06,560
Yeah. Sorry.

1434
01:30:08,930 --> 01:30:10,206
I got some understanding
of what you're going through...

1435
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:12,670
No, please don't tell me that
you know what I'm going through.

1436
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:14,450
Okay.

1437
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,150
She's gone.

1438
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:20,170
It's all my fault.

1439
01:30:24,230 --> 01:30:25,660
She died for nothing.

1440
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:31,580
So I'm gonna do what I
should've done in the first place.

1441
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,480
- Peter...
- Please, don't.

1442
01:30:34,770 --> 01:30:38,090
You don't belong here. Either
of you, so I'm sending you home.

1443
01:30:39,650 --> 01:30:41,700
Those other guys are
from your worlds, right?

1444
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:43,710
So you deal with it.

1445
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:45,740
If they die, if you kill them...

1446
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:48,420
That's on you.

1447
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:50,540
It's not my problem.

1448
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:52,110
I don't care anymore.

1449
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:54,580
I'm done.

1450
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:01,660
I'm really sorry that I
dragged you into this.

1451
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:06,870
But you have to go home now.

1452
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:10,700
Good luck.

1453
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,860
My Uncle Ben was killed.

1454
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:20,770
It was my fault.

1455
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:23,420
I lost...

1456
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:28,010
I lost Gwen. My...

1457
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,860
She was my MJ.

1458
01:31:33,470 --> 01:31:34,720
I couldn't save her.

1459
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:38,920
I'm never gonna be able
to forgive myself for that.

1460
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,980
But I carried on. Tried to...

1461
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:47,230
Tried to keep going.
Tried to keep being the...

1462
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,110
friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man, because

1463
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:52,596
I know that's what
she would have wanted.

1464
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:53,620
But...

1465
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:55,510
At some point, I just...

1466
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,220
I stopped pulling my punches.

1467
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:02,350
I got rageful.

1468
01:32:04,730 --> 01:32:05,790
I got bitter.

1469
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:11,710
I just don't want you,
to end up like... Like me.

1470
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:15,670
The night Ben died,

1471
01:32:16,730 --> 01:32:19,390
I hunted down the
man who I thought did it.

1472
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:22,560
I wanted him dead.

1473
01:32:25,010 --> 01:32:26,670
I got what I wanted.

1474
01:32:29,010 --> 01:32:30,730
It didn't make it better.

1475
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:36,980
It took me a long time to...

1476
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,990
learn to get through
that darkness.

1477
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:45,230
I wanna kill him.

1478
01:32:47,990 --> 01:32:49,340
I wanna tear him apart.

1479
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:55,400
I can still hear her
voice in my head.

1480
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:04,800
Even after she was hurt, she said
to me that we did the right thing.

1481
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:16,200
She told me that
with great power...

1482
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:19,910
comes great responsibility.

1483
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:26,700
Wait, what? How
do you know that?

1484
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:28,290
Uncle Ben said it.

1485
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:29,740
The day he died.

1486
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:36,270
Maybe she didn't
die for nothing, Peter.

1487
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,920
Okay, so...

1488
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:50,640
Connors, Marko, Dillon, and...

1489
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:56,350
Look, I think that I can repair the devices
for Dillon and Marko, but the others...

1490
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,720
Well, I got Connors. I've already
cured him once, so no big deal.

1491
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:02,760
What? It's no big deal.

1492
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:03,970
Great.

1493
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:05,870
Yeah. That's great.

1494
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:11,620
I think I can make an
antiserum for Dr. Osborn.

1495
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,170
Been thinking
about it a long time.

1496
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:18,870
Gotta cure all of them.

1497
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:20,080
Right?

1498
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:22,430
Right.

1499
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:25,520
That's what we do.

1500
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:34,770
What?

1501
01:34:35,310 --> 01:34:37,060
It's for yous.

1502
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:56,030
So...

1503
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,560
Do you have a best friend too?

1504
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:01,310
I did.

1505
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:04,640
You did?

1506
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,710
He died in my arms.

1507
01:35:09,610 --> 01:35:11,280
After he tried to kill me.

1508
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:14,720
It was heartbreaking.

1509
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,290
Run a diagnostic.

1510
01:35:27,630 --> 01:35:28,630
Okay.

1511
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:39,290
Hey, you okay?

1512
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:41,770
Yeah, I'm fine.

1513
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:47,570
You don't deserve this.

1514
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:50,270
I ruined your life...

1515
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:51,920
Hey. No, no, no, no, no.

1516
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:55,090
Look at me. I'm here.

1517
01:35:56,420 --> 01:35:57,770
I'm not going anywhere.

1518
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:02,250
We're gonna get through this.
We're gonna get through it together.

1519
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:04,360
Okay?

1520
01:36:06,070 --> 01:36:07,080
Okay.

1521
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,670
You have someone?

1522
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:28,530
No.

1523
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:33,100
I got no time for
Peter Parker stuff...

1524
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:34,450
You know?

1525
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:37,420
Do you?

1526
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:40,840
It's a little... complicated.

1527
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:42,660
I understand.

1528
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:44,950
I guess it's just not in
the cards for guys like us.

1529
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:46,230
Well...

1530
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:48,120
I wouldn't give up.

1531
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,670
Took a while, but...

1532
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,170
We made it work.

1533
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:52,630
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1534
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:53,890
Me and...

1535
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:55,390
MJ.

1536
01:36:57,050 --> 01:36:58,690
My MJ. She, uhh...

1537
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:01,530
It gets confusing, huh?

1538
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:04,740
Peter?

1539
01:37:04,770 --> 01:37:07,310
- Yeah? Oh, sorry. You mean...
- Yeah? Oh, sorry. You mean...

1540
01:37:08,370 --> 01:37:09,350
Peter-Peter.

1541
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:11,006
- We're all called Peter, Ned.
- Yeah. Peter?

1542
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:12,060
Peter Parker?

1543
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:14,130
- Same.
- We're all Peter Parker.

1544
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:15,520
The computer!

1545
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:18,660
- Oh, I'm ready.
- Yeah, me too.

1546
01:37:18,690 --> 01:37:23,610
Okay, so... Now, all we gotta do is
lure these guys someplace, right?

1547
01:37:23,850 --> 01:37:28,730
Try to cure them, while they try
to kill us, and then, send them home.

1548
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:30,350
Using a magic box?

1549
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:31,610
Well, that's the plan.

1550
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:33,376
So are you gonna go
into battle dressed as a

1551
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,810
cool, youth pastor, or
do you got your suit?

1552
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:38,700
Good.

1553
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:40,090
Here's your web cartridges.

1554
01:37:40,110 --> 01:37:41,180
Oh, thanks, Ned.

1555
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:42,450
What's that for?

1556
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:45,600
It's my web fluid. It's
for my web shooters. Why?

1557
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:50,690
- That came out of you?
- Yeah.

1558
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,780
- You can't do that, huh?
- No.

1559
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:54,140
How on Earth is that...

1560
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:55,340
Anyway, we're getting
sidetracked. Look, this

1561
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:57,580
is where we're gonna
do this, okay? It's isolated,

1562
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,360
so no one should get hurt.

1563
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:02,276
We draw them there with the
box, it's the one thing they all want.

1564
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:04,176
All we have to do is figure
out how we're gonna get there.

1565
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,560
Oh, we can portal there.

1566
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:06,760
- What?
- I magic now.

1567
01:38:06,830 --> 01:38:08,430
Yeah, no, no. He's
right. He can. He can.

1568
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:09,790
- Yeah, we saw him.
- Yeah. He is.

1569
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:12,740
- Wait, really?
- Dude, I got Doctor Strange magic.

1570
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:13,790
- What?
- Yeah!

1571
01:38:14,450 --> 01:38:15,560
And I promise you...

1572
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:17,800
I won't turn into a
supervillain and try to kill you.

1573
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:21,330
Okay...

1574
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:23,500
Thank you.

1575
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:29,370
Umm...

1576
01:38:29,740 --> 01:38:32,140
Alright. Here goes nothing.
What's that thing you always say?

1577
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,070
If you expect disappointment...

1578
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:35,110
No, no, no...

1579
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:37,910
We're gonna kick some ass.

1580
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:39,690
Okay.

1581
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:41,080
Cure.

1582
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,680
Cure some ass.

1583
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:44,160
Cure that ass.

1584
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:48,240
Ladies and gentlemen...

1585
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:50,000
The Bugle tip line
has just received a call

1586
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:53,440
from none other than the
fugitive known as Spider-Man.

1587
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:56,030
Fresh from his
rampage in Queens.

1588
01:38:56,810 --> 01:39:01,060
So, Peter Parker... What pernicious
propaganda are you peddling?

1589
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:02,990
- Just the truth.
- Oh, sure.

1590
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:04,260
Truth is...

1591
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,310
That this is all my fault.

1592
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:10,240
I accidentally brought
those dangerous people here.

1593
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:11,850
Well, he admits it!

1594
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:13,560
And if those people
are watching...

1595
01:39:15,670 --> 01:39:17,660
Just know that I really
did try to help you.

1596
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:20,290
I could've killed you.

1597
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:23,830
At any given
moment, but I didn't.

1598
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:28,850
Because my Aunt May taught me
that everyone deserves a second chance.

1599
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:30,460
And that's why I'm here.

1600
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:32,330
And where is here, exactly?

1601
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:36,270
A place that represents
second chances.

1602
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:41,730
The Statue of Liberty?
Good God, folks! He's

1603
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,910
about to destroy
another national landmark.

1604
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:46,880
The world, if you're watching...

1605
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:48,570
Believe me, the
world is watching.

1606
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:50,930
Wish me luck.

1607
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:55,110
Your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man could really use some.

1608
01:40:01,550 --> 01:40:03,760
Okay, guys. It could
be any minute now.

1609
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:05,860
Yup. Almost done.

1610
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:15,930
You know, Max was like,
the sweetest guy ever.

1611
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:17,310
Before he fell into a...

1612
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:19,740
pool of electric eels.

1613
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:21,080
That'll do it.

1614
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:25,090
There it goes...

1615
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:28,870
You okay?

1616
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:30,230
My back.

1617
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:33,320
It's kind of stiff from
all the swinging, I guess.

1618
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:35,170
Oh, yeah, no, I got a
little back pain, too.

1619
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:36,430
- Really?
- Yeah.

1620
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:38,400
You want me to crack it?

1621
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:40,390
Yeah.

1622
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:41,990
That would be great.

1623
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:44,050
You ready?

1624
01:40:44,090 --> 01:40:45,090
Yeah.

1625
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:49,740
That's good.

1626
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:51,600
How is it?

1627
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:52,640
Wow.

1628
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:54,990
- That's good.
- Right?

1629
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:56,050
- That's better.
- Yeah.

1630
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:57,140
Wow.

1631
01:41:00,410 --> 01:41:01,870
God, this is so cool.

1632
01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:03,480
I always wanted brothers.

1633
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:08,100
So you could like make your
own web fluid in your body?

1634
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:09,960
I'd rather not talk about this.

1635
01:41:10,010 --> 01:41:11,280
No, I don't mean to...

1636
01:41:11,310 --> 01:41:12,786
- Are you teasing me?
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

1637
01:41:12,810 --> 01:41:14,330
He's not teasing
you. It's just that...

1638
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:18,920
We can't do that, so naturally we're
curious as to how your web situation works.

1639
01:41:18,950 --> 01:41:19,770
That's all.

1640
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:22,260
If it's personal, I don't
wanna pry. I just think it's cool.

1641
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:25,320
No. I wish I could tell you,
but it's like, I don't do it...

1642
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:26,350
Like I don't...

1643
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:29,150
Like, I don't do breathing.
Like, breathing just happens.

1644
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:29,790
Whoa.

1645
01:41:29,810 --> 01:41:32,180
Like, does it just come
out of your wrists, or...

1646
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:34,490
Does it come out
of anywhere else?

1647
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:36,230
Only... only the wrists.

1648
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:38,786
You never had a web block?
Cause I run out of webs all the time.

1649
01:41:38,810 --> 01:41:40,700
I had to make my own lab.

1650
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:42,740
And it's a hassle.

1651
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:44,480
That sounds like a hassle. Yeah.

1652
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:47,010
But I did, actually, as
you said that. I was like...

1653
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:48,990
- I had a web block.
- Why?

1654
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:51,150
Existential crisis stuff.

1655
01:41:51,170 --> 01:41:52,700
Yeah, don't get me started on that.

1656
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:53,720
Hey...

1657
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:56,930
What are like, some of the craziest
villains that you guys have fought?

1658
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:58,860
Seems you've met some of them.

1659
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:00,440
That's a good question.

1660
01:42:00,510 --> 01:42:01,570
I fought a...

1661
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:03,010
an alien...

1662
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:05,340
made out of black goo once.

1663
01:42:05,410 --> 01:42:07,470
No way! I fought an alien, too.

1664
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:08,820
On Earth and in space.

1665
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:10,020
- Oh.
- Yeah. He was purple.

1666
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:11,160
I wanna fight an alien.

1667
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:12,720
I'm, I'm still, like...

1668
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:14,910
That you fought
an alien, in Space.

1669
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:16,680
I'm lame.

1670
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:18,640
Like, I fought a
Russian guy in a...

1671
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:20,490
Like a rhinoceros machine.

1672
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:22,930
Hey, can we wind it back
to the "I'm lame" part?

1673
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:24,140
'Cause, you are not.

1674
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:26,500
Aw, thanks. No, yeah. I appreciate
it, I'm not saying I'm lame.

1675
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,536
But it's just the self-talk
maybe we should, you know...

1676
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:29,730
- Yeah, listen...
- Please...

1677
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:31,550
You're... You're Amazing.

1678
01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:33,340
Just to take it in for a minute.

1679
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:35,880
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You... You are amazing.

1680
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:37,236
- I guess I am.
- You are amazing.

1681
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:38,620
- Thank you.
- Will you say it?

1682
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,370
No, I kinda needed to
hear that. Thank you.

1683
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:43,690
Alright guys, focus
up. Can you feel that?

1684
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:44,740
Yeah.

1685
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:53,550
What's up, Peter?

1686
01:42:56,130 --> 01:42:57,910
How do you like the new news?

1687
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:03,120
Look, you give it to
me, I'm gonna destroy it.

1688
01:43:03,650 --> 01:43:05,540
But I'll let you live.

1689
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:08,310
Don't make me a murderer, Peter.

1690
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:12,280
Okay, guys. Here it comes.

1691
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:19,960
Hey, Max!

1692
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:21,660
I missed you, man!

1693
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:26,120
All right, MJ, heads up!

1694
01:43:27,150 --> 01:43:28,570
Got it! Close it.

1695
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:34,380
- Okay...
- I know.

1696
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:36,116
- Why isn't it closing?
- I don't know... I...

1697
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:37,670
Have you closed before? No?

1698
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:39,830
No. I mean I have opened some.

1699
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:51,120
Max, Max, Max. Can we just talk
for a second? Just you and me, just...

1700
01:43:51,330 --> 01:43:54,590
Look who showed up!
Our old friend Spider-Man.

1701
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,836
I'm trying to save you, Max.
That's all I've ever wanted.

1702
01:43:56,860 --> 01:43:58,590
- You're not trying to save me.
- I am.

1703
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:00,560
You ain't even shit no more.

1704
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:04,160
Don't worry about
me. I'll save myself.

1705
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:09,160
I got his attention, now what?

1706
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:10,810
Open the cage!

1707
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:14,100
Just FYI, Lizard-guy
is here too.

1708
01:44:15,690 --> 01:44:17,530
Guys, comm check, hello.

1709
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:19,740
I need Max's cure.

1710
01:44:19,810 --> 01:44:21,320
Yeah. I'm on it.

1711
01:44:21,810 --> 01:44:23,760
Peter! I need the Lizard cure.

1712
01:44:23,850 --> 01:44:25,320
Okay! Okay!

1713
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:32,200
Where's the box, Peter?

1714
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:34,810
- Flint! We can help everyone.
- I don't care!

1715
01:44:46,630 --> 01:44:47,660
Sorry!

1716
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:52,840
I tried to tell you, Sandman.
Nobody's going home.

1717
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:33,810
What the hell, is
going on out there?

1718
01:45:33,850 --> 01:45:35,560
I kept yelling at you,
Peter 2, Peter 2...

1719
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:37,300
I know, but I thought
you're Peter 2?

1720
01:45:37,330 --> 01:45:38,730
What? I'm not Peter...

1721
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:40,540
Stop arguing, both of
you! Listen to Peter 1.

1722
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:42,720
Look, we're clearly
not very good at this!

1723
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:44,200
I know, I know. We suck.

1724
01:45:44,230 --> 01:45:46,150
I, I don't know how
to work as a team.

1725
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:47,140
Me neither.

1726
01:45:47,190 --> 01:45:49,070
Well I do. I have
been in a team, okay?

1727
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:50,830
I don't wanna brag, but I will.

1728
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,630
- I was in the Avengers.
- The Avengers?

1729
01:45:52,690 --> 01:45:54,000
- Yeah.
- That's great!

1730
01:45:54,030 --> 01:45:55,910
- Thank you.
- What is that?

1731
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:57,940
Wait, you don't
have the Avengers?

1732
01:45:58,010 --> 01:45:59,520
Is that a band?
Are you in a band?

1733
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,760
No, I'm not in a band.
No, the Avengers is a...

1734
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,620
- Earth's Mightiest...
- How is this helping?!

1735
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:06,780
Look, it's not important. All we
gotta do is focus, trust your tingle,

1736
01:46:06,810 --> 01:46:08,350
and coordinate our attacks, okay?

1737
01:46:08,380 --> 01:46:11,060
Yes. Okay. Let's
pick one target.

1738
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:11,880
Right.

1739
01:46:11,910 --> 01:46:13,506
We take them off the
board one at a time.

1740
01:46:13,530 --> 01:46:14,680
Now you got it. Okay...

1741
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:15,960
- Peter 1, Peter 2...
- Peter 2.

1742
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:17,160
- Peter 3.
- Peter 3!

1743
01:46:17,190 --> 01:46:19,510
- All right, let's do this...
- No, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1744
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:21,630
I love you guys.

1745
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:25,270
Thank you.

1746
01:46:26,910 --> 01:46:28,480
- All right. Let's do this.
- Let's go.

1747
01:46:58,340 --> 01:46:59,640
Okay, Spider-Man.

1748
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:01,510
Sandman first.

1749
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:04,750
I'm gonna lead him
inside the statue.

1750
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:06,240
I'll meet you at the top.

1751
01:47:13,420 --> 01:47:16,420
- Hey, Dr. Connors.
- Hello, Peter.

1752
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:18,830
Peter 1!

1753
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:20,360
I got it.

1754
01:47:31,590 --> 01:47:33,950
Flint! We're trying to help you!

1755
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:37,230
Guys, I'm at the top!

1756
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:39,390
I need the cure!

1757
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:43,199
I'm coming, I'm
coming, I'm coming!

1758
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:48,849
Just wait your turn!

1759
01:47:48,850 --> 01:47:50,230
I'll be right back.

1760
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:28,790
It's okay, Flint.

1761
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:32,260
We're gonna get you home.

1762
01:48:33,070 --> 01:48:35,690
Just... stay right here.

1763
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:42,436
How do we stop him? I've
never seen him this powerful.

1764
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:44,560
It's the arc reactor.
We gotta get it off him.

1765
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:46,590
You're not gonna
take this away from me.

1766
01:48:49,230 --> 01:48:50,560
That's not gonna work.

1767
01:48:55,590 --> 01:48:57,300
Okay, we've gotta
do this up close.

1768
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:00,290
Peter 2 go right,
Peter 3 go left. On me.

1769
01:49:30,610 --> 01:49:33,780
All right, we're fine. We're gonna do
it again. We're just gonna keep trying.

1770
01:49:33,810 --> 01:49:35,850
Alright. We got it.
I got it. Got this.

1771
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:37,490
Close the portal.

1772
01:49:40,350 --> 01:49:41,890
Oh, no. No, no, no!

1773
01:49:42,020 --> 01:49:44,430
Ned, that is a lizard,
and we should...

1774
01:49:49,130 --> 01:49:50,130
Run!

1775
01:49:53,530 --> 01:49:55,070
Connors, stop!

1776
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:05,060
Yeah.

1777
01:50:17,490 --> 01:50:19,930
Leave them. They're mine.

1778
01:50:20,450 --> 01:50:23,090
I don't need your
help. I got it just fine.

1779
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:25,380
Dr. Octavius. No.

1780
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,030
What are you doing?

1781
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:31,740
Get it off me!

1782
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:44,320
There you go.

1783
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:04,570
MJ!

1784
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,440
- We need help with this thing.
- Right, right, right.

1785
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:29,030
Where is he?

1786
01:51:29,870 --> 01:51:30,460
Wait, wait, wait!

1787
01:51:30,490 --> 01:51:33,100
Before you do anything,
Mister... Doctor Strange, sir, well...

1788
01:51:33,310 --> 01:51:34,450
Peter's plan is working.

1789
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:36,510
- What plan?
- He's curing them.

1790
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:46,620
Dr. Connors?

1791
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,020
Welcome back, sir.

1792
01:51:52,970 --> 01:51:54,360
Well, I'll be damned.

1793
01:51:57,170 --> 01:51:58,910
Did you just open a portal?

1794
01:51:59,910 --> 01:52:01,100
Yes, yes, sir. I did.

1795
01:52:09,210 --> 01:52:10,210
Max.

1796
01:52:11,310 --> 01:52:12,310
Max...

1797
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:13,760
Don't worry.

1798
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:16,310
- I'm all tapped out.
- You sure about that?

1799
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:19,190
I'm back to being a nobody.

1800
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:22,490
- You were never a nobody, Max.
- Yes, I was. Yes, I was.

1801
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,050
You don't see me.

1802
01:52:25,710 --> 01:52:27,040
Can I tell you something?

1803
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:28,720
Yeah.

1804
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:31,540
You got a nice face.
You're just a kid.

1805
01:52:32,060 --> 01:52:33,560
You're from Queens...

1806
01:52:34,700 --> 01:52:36,030
You got that suit...

1807
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:37,580
You help a lot of poor people...

1808
01:52:38,220 --> 01:52:39,790
I just thought you
was gonna be black.

1809
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:42,660
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

1810
01:52:42,990 --> 01:52:45,940
Don't mind it. There's gotta be a
black Spider-Man somehwere out there.

1811
01:52:49,850 --> 01:52:51,230
Goddamn eels.

1812
01:52:54,610 --> 01:52:56,190
The power of the sun...

1813
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:01,200
in the palm of your hand.

1814
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:02,550
Peter?

1815
01:53:04,540 --> 01:53:05,580
Otto.

1816
01:53:07,350 --> 01:53:09,310
Oh, it's good to
see you, dear boy.

1817
01:53:10,130 --> 01:53:11,900
It's good to see you.

1818
01:53:12,030 --> 01:53:13,680
You're all grown up.

1819
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:16,100
How are you?

1820
01:53:18,340 --> 01:53:19,750
Trying to do better.

1821
01:53:26,930 --> 01:53:28,329
Strange, we're so close...

1822
01:53:28,330 --> 01:53:29,270
Skip it!

1823
01:53:29,271 --> 01:53:31,940
I've been dangling over the
Grand Canyon for twelve hours!

1824
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:34,050
I know. I know, I
know, I know. I...

1825
01:53:35,310 --> 01:53:37,270
I'm sorry about
that, sir. I mean...

1826
01:53:38,030 --> 01:53:39,450
You went to the Grand Canyon?

1827
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:41,796
- He could've used your help.
- No, no. It's okay, it's okay.

1828
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:43,490
These are my new
friends. This is Peter Parker,

1829
01:53:43,510 --> 01:53:45,240
he's Peter Parker.
Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

1830
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:47,810
They're mes from other
universes. They're here to help.

1831
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:49,616
This is the wizard that
I was telling you about.

1832
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:53,410
Look, I am really impressed that you managed
to give them all a second chance, kid.

1833
01:53:54,530 --> 01:53:56,530
But this has to end, now.

1834
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:59,870
Can the Spider-Man
come out to play?

1835
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:23,170
Strange, no!

1836
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:54,860
Are you okay?

1837
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:57,880
Yeah. I'm okay.

1838
01:55:00,270 --> 01:55:02,360
Are you okay?

1839
01:56:18,370 --> 01:56:20,060
Thank you, Mister Cape, sir.

1840
01:56:23,450 --> 01:56:24,450
Ned!

1841
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:32,660
MJ!

1842
01:56:32,820 --> 01:56:33,820
Peter?

1843
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:35,719
- Ned!
- Peter?

1844
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:36,760
Hey.

1845
01:56:37,180 --> 01:56:39,460
- Are you okay?
- We're okay.

1846
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:53,840
Poor Peter.

1847
01:56:54,230 --> 01:56:57,720
Too weak to send me home to die.

1848
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:01,350
I just wanna kill you myself.

1849
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:03,230
Attaboy.

1850
01:58:53,410 --> 01:58:54,990
She was there.

1851
01:58:55,470 --> 01:58:57,430
Because of you...

1852
01:58:57,620 --> 01:59:00,500
I may have struck the blow.

1853
01:59:00,730 --> 01:59:02,900
But you?

1854
01:59:05,420 --> 01:59:09,160
You are the one that killed her.

1855
01:59:36,180 --> 01:59:37,180
Peter?

1856
01:59:51,010 --> 01:59:52,340
What have I done?

1857
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:58,790
- It's you.
- You okay?

1858
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:01,850
Yeah, I'm good. I've
been stabbed before.

1859
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:03,100
Hey.

1860
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,660
Hey, nice catch.

1861
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:07,360
Nice throw.

1862
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:13,019
Is that happening? Or am I dying?

1863
02:00:13,020 --> 02:00:14,624
Yeah, no, that's happening.
That's real.

1864
02:00:14,630 --> 02:00:16,300
Are there people in the sky?

1865
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:25,910
- I gotta go.
- Yeah. Yeah, I got him.

1866
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:32,480
What's happening?

1867
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:34,566
They're starting to come
through and I can't stop them.

1868
02:00:34,590 --> 02:00:37,720
There's got to be something we can
do. Can't you just cast a spell again?

1869
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:39,466
Like the original way.
Before I screwed it up.

1870
02:00:39,490 --> 02:00:41,160
We're too late for
that. They're here.

1871
02:00:43,110 --> 02:00:44,670
They're here because of you.

1872
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:51,600
What if everyone
forgot who I was?

1873
02:00:51,720 --> 02:00:52,720
What?

1874
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:54,546
They're coming here
because of me, right?

1875
02:00:54,570 --> 02:00:57,690
Because I'm Peter
Parker? So cast a new spell.

1876
02:00:57,850 --> 02:01:00,070
But this time, make everyone
forget who Peter Parker is.

1877
02:01:00,090 --> 02:01:01,820
Make everyone forget...

1878
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:03,920
Me.

1879
02:01:04,030 --> 02:01:04,630
No.

1880
02:01:04,890 --> 02:01:06,150
But it would work, right?

1881
02:01:06,310 --> 02:01:07,320
Yeah, it would work.

1882
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:13,320
But you got to understand, that would
mean everyone, who knows and loves you

1883
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:14,510
We'd...

1884
02:01:15,870 --> 02:01:17,740
We'd have no memory of you.

1885
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:21,560
It'll be as though
you never existed.

1886
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:25,880
I know.

1887
02:01:28,940 --> 02:01:29,940
Do it.

1888
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:36,180
Then go and say your
goodbyes. You don't have long.

1889
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:37,550
Thank you, sir.

1890
02:01:37,770 --> 02:01:39,160
Call me Stephen.

1891
02:01:42,100 --> 02:01:43,360
Thank you, Stephen.

1892
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:46,120
Yeah...

1893
02:01:46,980 --> 02:01:48,330
Still feels weird.

1894
02:01:50,980 --> 02:01:52,060
I'll see you around.

1895
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:55,190
So long, kid.

1896
02:02:04,810 --> 02:02:06,860
I think this is it. I think
you're about to go home.

1897
02:02:07,580 --> 02:02:09,970
But I... uhh...

1898
02:02:12,430 --> 02:02:13,430
Thank you.

1899
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:15,630
I just wanted...

1900
02:02:15,780 --> 02:02:17,320
I wanna tell you that...

1901
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:19,870
I really don't know
how to say this, like...

1902
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:20,640
Peter.

1903
02:02:20,670 --> 02:02:21,880
I want you to know that I...

1904
02:02:23,590 --> 02:02:24,590
We know.

1905
02:02:25,330 --> 02:02:26,420
It's what we do.

1906
02:02:28,060 --> 02:02:29,350
Yeah. It's what we do.

1907
02:02:30,900 --> 02:02:32,850
Right. I gotta find Ned and MJ.

1908
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:37,520
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you!

1909
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:42,470
I guess I'll see you.

1910
02:02:42,970 --> 02:02:44,540
- Keep safe.
- Bye.

1911
02:02:47,790 --> 02:02:49,250
You're in so much pain, huh?

1912
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:50,280
- I am.
- Yeah.

1913
02:03:00,090 --> 02:03:00,960
Are you okay?

1914
02:03:00,990 --> 02:03:01,990
Yeah, we're okay.

1915
02:03:02,550 --> 02:03:03,566
Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

1916
02:03:03,590 --> 02:03:05,440
- No. I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

1917
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:07,280
I'm fine. I promise.

1918
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,880
We should go, right?

1919
02:03:16,290 --> 02:03:17,820
You're gonna forget who I am.

1920
02:03:20,050 --> 02:03:22,320
- What?
- Peter, what are you talking about?

1921
02:03:23,770 --> 02:03:24,770
It's okay...

1922
02:03:25,140 --> 02:03:26,360
I'm gonna come and find you,

1923
02:03:26,870 --> 02:03:28,330
and I'll explain everything.

1924
02:03:31,030 --> 02:03:32,070
I'll make you remember me.

1925
02:03:33,310 --> 02:03:34,910
It'll be like none of
this ever happened.

1926
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:36,190
Okay?

1927
02:03:36,330 --> 02:03:38,010
But what if that doesn't work?

1928
02:03:38,110 --> 02:03:40,970
What if that doesn't work,
what if we can't remember you?

1929
02:03:40,990 --> 02:03:42,040
I don't wanna do that.

1930
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:44,300
I don't wanna do that.

1931
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:45,340
I know. MJ, I know.

1932
02:03:46,140 --> 02:03:47,486
There's gotta be
something we can do.

1933
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:50,790
We can come up with like a plan or something?
There's gotta be something we can do.

1934
02:03:52,410 --> 02:03:53,820
There's nothing we can do.

1935
02:03:58,420 --> 02:03:59,500
But we'll be okay.

1936
02:04:03,970 --> 02:04:04,970
Promise?

1937
02:04:07,400 --> 02:04:08,890
Yeah, I promise.

1938
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:21,700
I'll come find you. Okay?

1939
02:04:22,700 --> 02:04:23,700
I know you will.

1940
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:29,370
You better.

1941
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:33,010
If you don't, i'm just gonna figure it out.

1942
02:04:34,060 --> 02:04:35,800
I've done it before, i can do it again.

1943
02:04:37,030 --> 02:04:38,690
I promise I'll fix this.

1944
02:04:39,830 --> 02:04:40,920
I really hate magic.

1945
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:43,760
Yeah. Me, too.

1946
02:04:48,550 --> 02:04:49,550
I love you.

1947
02:04:55,750 --> 02:04:57,160
- I love you...
- Just wait

1948
02:04:58,220 --> 02:05:00,660
Wait, and tell me
when you see me again.

1949
02:07:13,370 --> 02:07:16,160
It's been a few weeks since the
fiasco on the Statue of Liberty,

1950
02:07:16,190 --> 02:07:18,380
and Spider-Man's cultists
continue to contend

1951
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:21,630
that the vile
vigilante is a hero.

1952
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:26,510
But if he were a hero, he'd unmask
himself and tell us who he really is.

1953
02:07:26,700 --> 02:07:29,780
Because only a coward
conceals his identity.

1954
02:07:30,260 --> 02:07:33,220
Only a coward hides
his true intentions.

1955
02:07:33,430 --> 02:07:36,940
Rest assured, ladies and gentlemen,
that this reporter will uncover those...

1956
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:40,780
Hi.

1957
02:07:40,850 --> 02:07:43,470
My name is Peter Parker.
You don't know me, but I...

1958
02:07:46,040 --> 02:07:48,700
My name is Peter Parker
and you don't know me, but...

1959
02:07:52,170 --> 02:07:53,170
Okay...

1960
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:57,930
- No way.
- Hard to believe, isn't it?

1961
02:08:07,410 --> 02:08:08,410
Hey.

1962
02:08:14,540 --> 02:08:15,140
One sec.

1963
02:08:15,150 --> 02:08:16,550
Can I help you?

1964
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:17,860
Hi. Umm...

1965
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:19,480
My name is Peter Parker.

1966
02:08:19,610 --> 02:08:20,970
And I...

1967
02:08:24,240 --> 02:08:26,900
would like a coffee. Please.

1968
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:30,160
Okay, no problem, Peter Parker.

1969
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:39,070
Donuts for my fellow engineer.

1970
02:08:39,650 --> 02:08:41,890
- Wait, what?
- MIT, they have the engineers. The mascot.

1971
02:08:42,490 --> 02:08:44,740
Oh, right, right, right.
I should probably know that.

1972
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,750
Look at you with
the school spirit.

1973
02:08:47,740 --> 02:08:49,430
Tell anybody, i will deny it.

1974
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:02,420
Peter Parker?

1975
02:09:02,930 --> 02:09:03,930
Peter Parker?

1976
02:09:04,470 --> 02:09:05,600
Your coffee.

1977
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:06,800
Right. Thank you.

1978
02:09:09,620 --> 02:09:11,460
Are you excited for MIT?

1979
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:15,270
Right. Yeah.

1980
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:18,370
Yeah, actually I am
excited, which is weird

1981
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:20,030
because I don't really
get excited about things.

1982
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:22,100
I kind of expect disappointment.

1983
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:24,570
'Cause then you'd never
actually be disappointed.

1984
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:26,600
Right?

1985
02:09:29,420 --> 02:09:30,980
Yeah. Right.

1986
02:09:32,610 --> 02:09:33,650
It's just... I don't know...

1987
02:09:33,670 --> 02:09:35,920
It just kinda feels different
this time for some reason.

1988
02:09:50,850 --> 02:09:51,850
That was...

1989
02:10:01,560 --> 02:10:02,560
You okay?

1990
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:05,170
Doesn't really hurt anymore.

1991
02:10:16,620 --> 02:10:18,020
Is there anything else?

1992
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:31,420
No.

1993
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:36,120
Thank you.

1994
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:38,380
No problem.

1995
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:46,350
See you around.

1996
02:11:51,340 --> 02:11:52,760
How do you know her?

1997
02:11:56,450 --> 02:11:58,220
Through Spider-Man.

1998
02:11:58,990 --> 02:12:00,970
- You?
- Same.

1999
02:12:06,220 --> 02:12:09,010
I lost a good friend a while back.

2000
02:12:09,070 --> 02:12:10,130
It felt like this.

2001
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:13,940
It hurts 'cause they're gone,

2002
02:12:13,950 --> 02:12:16,826
and then it hurts all over again because
you remember what they stood for,

2003
02:12:16,850 --> 02:12:18,080
and you wonder...

2004
02:12:18,650 --> 02:12:20,390
Is all that gone too?

2005
02:12:24,570 --> 02:12:26,070
No, it's not gone.

2006
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:30,670
Everybody she helped...

2007
02:12:32,970 --> 02:12:34,120
they'll keep it going.

2008
02:12:35,390 --> 02:12:36,660
You really think so?

2009
02:12:38,030 --> 02:12:39,030
I know it.

2010
02:12:41,010 --> 02:12:42,320
Take care of yourself, okay?

2011
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:44,370
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

2012
02:12:51,940 --> 02:12:53,600
Rent is due on the first of the month.

2013
02:12:54,570 --> 02:12:55,570
Don't be late.

2014
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:49,500
4-3 Edward, do you need EMS assist?

2015
02:13:49,550 --> 02:13:52,380
Negative, Central.
We're gonna need a car tow.

2016
02:17:05,210 --> 02:17:06,210
Okay...

2017
02:17:07,700 --> 02:17:11,820
Okay, I think I got this. You're
saying that this whole place...

2018
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:15,190
here. It's just tons of...

2019
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:17,200
Superpeople.

2020
02:17:17,220 --> 02:17:20,290
And he has been
saying it for hours.

2021
02:17:21,030 --> 02:17:24,250
All right, tell me again.
I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.

2022
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:28,400
There was a billionaire. He had
a tin suit, and he could fly. Right?

2023
02:17:30,320 --> 02:17:33,330
Okay. And there was a
really angry green man.

2024
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:35,180
- Hulk.
- Hulk.

2025
02:17:35,220 --> 02:17:37,720
And you thought Lethal
Protector was a shit name.

2026
02:17:37,740 --> 02:17:39,570
Yeah, because it is.

2027
02:17:39,590 --> 02:17:44,040
Now, tell me again about your
purple alien that loves stones.

2028
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:46,880
'Cause I'll tell you what, man.
Aliens, they do not love stones.

2029
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:48,560
Eddie, don't start!

2030
02:17:48,590 --> 02:17:50,860
You know what aliens
love? Eating brains!

2031
02:17:50,910 --> 02:17:53,200
Because that's what
they do. All right?

2032
02:17:53,360 --> 02:17:56,060
Senor, he made
my family disappear.

2033
02:17:57,390 --> 02:17:58,390
For five years.

2034
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:00,860
Five years?

2035
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:04,250
That's a long time.

2036
02:18:06,850 --> 02:18:10,920
I mean, maybe I should go
to New York and speak to this,

2037
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:13,600
Spider-Man.

2038
02:18:13,820 --> 02:18:16,590
Eddie! We are drunk!

2039
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:21,260
- Let's go skinny-dip!
- I don't think we should skinny-dip.

2040
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:22,520
Sir, you have to pay your bill.

2041
02:18:22,570 --> 02:18:27,080
What is happening? No! We
just got here. No, not again!

2042
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:32,550
And there he goes.

2043
02:18:33,470 --> 02:18:36,200
Without paying the
bill, no tips, nothing.

2044
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:14,220
Don't cast that spell.

2045
02:21:14,480 --> 02:21:15,660
It's too dangerous.

2046
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:16,230
Why?

2047
02:21:16,590 --> 02:21:19,080
We tampered with the
stability of space-time...

2048
02:21:19,980 --> 02:21:21,320
The Multiverse...

2049
02:21:21,640 --> 02:21:24,230
is a concept about which
we know frighteningly little.

2050
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:29,120
Your desecration of reality...

2051
02:21:30,260 --> 02:21:32,040
Will not go unpunished.

2052
02:21:37,420 --> 02:21:38,800
It was the only way.

2053
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:45,180
But I never

2054
02:21:45,580 --> 02:21:48,440
meant for any of this to happen.

2055
02:22:06,910 --> 02:22:07,910
Wanda.

2056
02:22:10,490 --> 02:22:12,820
I knew at some point
that you would show up.

2057
02:22:14,020 --> 02:22:15,330
I made mistakes.

2058
02:22:15,580 --> 02:22:17,230
And people were hurt.

2059
02:22:17,270 --> 02:22:19,740
I'm not here to talk
about Westview.

2060
02:22:20,220 --> 02:22:21,530
Then what are you here for?

2061
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:22,970
I need your help.

2062
02:22:24,220 --> 02:22:25,260
With what?

2063
02:22:25,430 --> 02:22:27,100
What do you know
about the Multiverse?

2064
02:22:36,100 --> 02:22:37,880
I'm sorry, Stephen.

2065
02:22:39,740 --> 02:22:41,940
I hope you understand.

2066
02:22:44,430 --> 02:22:46,140
The greatest threat...

2067
02:22:47,330 --> 02:22:49,360
to our universe...

2068
02:22:57,360 --> 02:22:59,630
is you.

2069
02:23:01,350 --> 02:23:04,460
Things just got out of hand.
